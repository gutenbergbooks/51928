      OLIVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE house in old
      Cottarsport in which Olive Stanes lived was set midway on the steepness of
      Orange Street. It was a low dwelling of weathered boards holding close to
      the rocky soil, resembling, like practically all the Cottarsport
      buildings, the salt weed clinging to the seaward rocks of the harbor; and
      Orange Street, narrow, without walks, and dipping into cuplike
      depressions, was a type of almost all the streets. The Stanes house was
      built with its gable to the public way; the length faced a granite
      shoulder thrust up through the spare earth, a tall, weedy disorder of
      golden glow, and the sedgy incline to the habitation above.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hester and Jem and then Rhoda were little they had had great joy of
      the boulder in the side yard: it was for them first impossible and then
      difficult of accomplishment; but they had rapidly grown into a complete
      mastery of its potentialities as a fort, a mansion impressive as that of
      the Canderays' on Regent Street, and a ship under the dangerous shore of
      the Feejees. Olive, the solitary child of Ira Stanes' first marriage, had
      had no such reckless pleasure from the rock&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been, she realized, standing in the narrow portico that commanded
      by two steps the uneven flagging from the street, a very careful, yes,
      considerate, child when measured by the gay irresponsibility of her half
      brother and sisters. Money had been no more plentiful in the Stanes
      family, nor in all Cottarsport, then than now; her dresses had been few,
      she had been told not to soil or tear them, and she had rigorously
      attended the instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second Mrs. Stanes, otherwise an admirable wife and mother, had, to
      Olive's young disapproval, rather encouraged a boisterous conduct in her
      children which overlooked a complete cleanliness or tidy array. And when
      she, like her predecessor, had died, and left Olive at twenty-three to
      assume full maternal responsibilities, that serious vicarious parent had
      entered into an inevitable and largely unavailing struggle against the
      minor damage caused mostly by the activities about the boulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Hester and Rhoda had left behind such purely imaginative games, and
      Jem was away fishing on the Georges Bank; her duty and worries had
      shifted, but not lessened; while the rock remained precisely as it had
      been through the children's growth, as it had appeared in her own earliest
      memories, as it was before ever the Stanes dwelling, now a hundred and
      fifty years in place, or old Cottarsport itself, had been dreamed of. Her
      thoughts were mixed: at once they created a vague parallel between the
      granite in the side yard and herself, Olive Stanes&mdash;they both seemed
      to have been so long in one spot, so unchanged; and they dwelt on the fact
      that soon&mdash;as soon as Jason Burrage got home&mdash;she must be
      utterly different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason had written her that, if they cared to, they could build a house as
      large as the Canderays'. Under the circumstances she had been obliged to
      look on that as, perhaps, an excusable exaggeration, though she
      instinctively condemned the dereliction of the truth; yet, more than any
      other figure could possibly have done, it impressed upon her, from the
      boldness of the imagery, that Jason had succeeded in finding the gold for
      which he had gone in search nine years before. He was coming back, soon,
      rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other important fact reiterated in his last letter, that in all his
      absent years of struggle he had never faltered in his purpose of coming to
      her with any fortune he might chance to get, she regarded with scant
      thought. It had not occurred to Olive that Jason Burrage would do anything
      else; her only concern had been that he might be killed; otherwise he had
      said that he loved her, and that they were to marry when he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hadn't, really, been in favor of his going. The Burrages, measured by
      Cottarsport standards, were comfortably situated&mdash;Mr. Burrage's
      packing warehouse and employment in dried fish were locally called
      successful&mdash;but Jason had never been satisfied with familiar values;
      he had always exclaimed against the narrowness of his local circumstance,
      and restlessly reached toward greater possessions and a wider horizon.
      This dissatisfaction Olive had thought wicked, in that it had seemed to
      criticize the omnipotent and far-seeing wisdom of the Eternal; it had
      caused her much unhappiness and prayer, she had talked very earnestly to
      Jason about his stubborn spirit, but it had persisted in him, and at last
      carried him west in the first madness of the discovery of gold in a
      California river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive, at times, thought that Jason's revolt had been brought about by the
      visible example of the worldly pomp of the Canderays&mdash;of their great
      white house with the balustraded captain's walk on the gambreled roof,
      their chaise, and equable but slightly disconcerting courtesy. But she had
      been obliged to admit that, after all was said, Jason's bearing was the
      result of his own fretful heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always been different from the other Cottarsport youths and men:
      while they were commonly long and bony, and awkwardly hung together,
      thickly tanned by the winds and sun and spray of the sea, Jason was small,
      compact, with dead black hair and pale skin. Mr. Burrage, who resembled a
      worn and discolored piece of driftwood, was the usual Cottarsport old man;
      but his wife, not conspicuously out of the ordinary, still had a snap in
      her unfading eyes, a ruddy roundness of cheek, that showed a lingering
      trace of a French Acadian intermarriage a century and more ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive always regarded with something like surprise her unquestioned love
      for Jason. It had grown quietly, unknown to her, through a number of
      preliminary years in which she had felt that she must exert some influence
      for his good. He frightened her a little by his hot utterances and by the
      manner in which his soul shivered on the verge of a righteous damnation.
      The effort to preserve him from such destruction became intenser and more
      involved; until suddenly, to her later consternation, she had surrendered
      her lips in a single, binding kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with that consummation a great deal of her troubling had ceased;
      spiritual vision, she had been certain, must follow their sacred union and
      subsequent life. Even the gold agitation and Jason's departure for Boston
      and the western wild had not given her especial concern. God was the
      supreme Master of human fate, and if He willed for Jason to go forth, who
      was she, Olive Stanes, to make a to-do? She had quietly addressed herself
      to the task of Hester, Jem, and Rhoda, to the ordering of her father's
      household&mdash;he was mostly away on the sea and a solitary man at home&mdash;and
      the formal recurrence of the occasions of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such ways, she thought, bathed in the keen, pale red glow of a late
      afternoon in October, her youth had slipped imperceptibly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong salt wind dipped into the hollow, and plastered her skirt,
      without hoops, against her erect, thin person. With the instinct, bred by
      the sea, of the presence in all calculations of the weather, she
      mechanically dwelt on its force and direction, wrinkling her forehead and
      pinching her lips&mdash;she could hear the rising wind straining through
      the elms on the hills behind Cottarsport&mdash;and then she turned
      abruptly and entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small dark hallway within, a narrow flight of stairs leading
      sharply up; the door on the right, to the formal chamber, was closed; but
      at the left an interior of somber scrubbed wood was visible. On the side
      against the hall a cavernous fireplace, with a brick hearth, blackened
      with shadows and the soot of ancient fires, had been left open, but held
      an air-tight sheet-iron stove. The windows, high on the walls, were small
      and long, rather than deep; and a table, perpetually spread, stood on a
      thick hooked rug of brilliant, primitive design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda, in a creaking birch rocker, was singing an inarticulated song with
      closed eyes. Her voice, giving the impression of being subdued, filled the
      room with its vibrant power. She had a mature face for sixteen years,
      vividly colored and sensitive, a wide mouth, and heavy twists of russet
      hair with metallic lights. The song stopped as Olive entered. Rhoda said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Hester would hurry home; I'm dreadful hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes they keep her at the packing house, especially if there's a
      boat in late and extra work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not very smart of her without being paid more. They'll just put
      anything on you they can in this stingy place. I can tell you I wouldn't
      do two men's work for a woman's pay. I'm awful glad Jason's coming back
      soon, Olive, with all that money, and I can go to Boston and study
      singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've said over and over, Rhoda,&rdquo; Olive replied patiently, &ldquo;that you
      mustn't think and talk all the time about Jason's worldly success. It
      doesn't sound nice, but like we were all trying to get everything we could
      out of him before ever he's here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he say in the last letter that I was to go to Boston?&rdquo; Rhoda
      exclaimed impatiently. &ldquo;Didn't he just up and tell me that? Why, with all
      the gold Jason's got it won't mean anything for him to send me away. It
      isn't as if I wouldn't pay you all back for the trouble I've been. I know
      I can sing, and I'll work harder than ever Hester dreamed of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if materialized by the pronunciation of her name, the latter entered
      the room. &ldquo;Gracious, Hester,&rdquo; Rhoda declared distastefully, making a nose,
      &ldquo;you smell of dead haddock right this minute.&rdquo; Hester, unlike Rhoda's
      softly rounded proportions, was more bony than Olive, infinitely more
      colorless, although ten years the younger. She had a black worsted scarf
      over her drab head in place of a hat, its ends wrapped about her meager
      shoulders and bombazine waist. Without preliminary she dropped into her
      place at the supper table, the shawl trailing on the broad, uneven boards
      of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind's smartening up on the bay,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;Captain Eagleston
      looks for half a blow. It has got cold, too. I wish the tea'd be ready
      when I get in from the packing house. It seems that much could be done,
      with Olive only sitting around and Rhoda singing to herself in the mirror
      on her dresser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll draw in a minute more,&rdquo; Olive said in the door from the kitchen,
      beyond the fireplace. Rhoda smiled cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Hester went on, in a voice without emphasis that yet
      contrived to be thinly bitter, &ldquo;you were all talking about what would
      happen when Jason came home with that fortune of his. Far as I can see
      he's promised and provided for everybody, Jem and Rhoda and his parents
      and Olive, every Tom and Noddy, but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to keep on about it,&rdquo; Olive protested, pained. &ldquo;Yet you
      can't see, Hester, how independent you are. A person wouldn't like to
      offer you anything until you had signified. You were never very nice with
      Jason anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not going to be nicer after he's back with gold in his pocket.
      I guess he'll find I'm not hanging on his shoulder for a cashmere dress or
      a trip to Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa ought to get into Salem soon,&rdquo; Rhoda observed. &ldquo;He said after this he
      wasn't going to ship again, even along the coast, but tally fish for Mr.
      Burrage. Pa's getting old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jem'll be home from the Georges, too,&rdquo; Olive added, seating herself
      with the tea. &ldquo;I do hope he won't sign for China or any of those long
      voyages like he threatened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't get so far away from Jason,&rdquo; Hester stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Honora Canderay today,&rdquo; Rhoda informed them. &ldquo;She wasn't in the
      carriage, but walking past the courthouse. She had on a small bonnet with
      flowers inside the brim and skimpy hoops, gallooned and scalloped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she stop?&rdquo; Olive inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and said I was as bright as a fall maple leaf. I wish I could look
      like Honora Canderay&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till Jason's back,&rdquo; Hester interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't her clothes,&rdquo; Rhoda went on; &ldquo;they're elegant material, of
      course, but not the colors I'd choose; nor it isn't her looks, either, no
      one would say she's downright pretty; it's just&mdash;just her. Is she as
      old as you, Olive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see, I'm thirty-six, and Honora Canderay was... she's near as old,
      a year younger maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is wonderful to get close to,&rdquo; said Rhoda, &ldquo;no cologne and yet a
      lovely kind of smell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like dead haddock.&rdquo; This was Hester again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; proceeded the younger, &ldquo;she seemed to me kind of lonely. I
      wanted to give her a hug, but I wouldn't have for all the gold in
      California. I can't make out if she is freezing outside and nice in, or
      just polite and thinks nobody's good enough for her. She had an India
      shawl as big as a sail, with palm leaf ends, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rhoda, I wish you wouldn't put so much on clothes and such corruption.&rdquo;
       Olive spoke firmly, with a light of zeal in her gaze. &ldquo;Can't you think on
      the eternities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Jason Burrage and Honora Canderay,&rdquo; explained Hester; &ldquo;Honora
      Canderay and Jason Burrage. They're eternities if there ever were any. If
      it isn't one it's bound to be the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive's room had a sloping outer wall and casually placed insufficient
      windows; her bed, with a blue-white quilt, was supported by heavy maple
      posts; there were a chest of drawers, with a minute mirror stand, a
      utilitarian wash-pitcher and basin, a hanging for the protection of her
      clothes, and uncompromising chairs. A small circular table with a tatted
      cover held her Bible and a devotional book, &ldquo;The Family Companion, by a
      Pastor.&rdquo; It was cold when she went up to bed; with a desire to linger in
      her preparations, she put some resinous sticks of wood into a sheet-iron
      stove, and almost immediately there was a busily exploding combustion. A
      glass lamp on the chest of drawers shed a pale illumination that failed to
      reach the confines of the room; and, for a while, she moved in and out of
      its wan influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking fixedly about Jason Burrage, and the great impending
      change in her condition, not in its worldly implications&mdash;she thought
      mostly of material values in the spirit of her admonitions to Rhoda&mdash;but
      in its personal and inner force. At times a pale question of her aptitude
      for marriage disturbed her serenity; at times she saw it as a sacrifice of
      her being to a condition commanded of God, a species of martyrdom even.
      The nine years of Jason's absence had fixed certain maidenly habits of
      privacy; the mold of her life had taken a definite cast. Her existence had
      its routine, the recurrence of Sunday, its contemplations, duties, and
      heavenly aim. And, lately, Jason's letters had disturbed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed filled with an almost wicked pride and a disconcerting energy;
      he spoke of things instinctively distressing to her; there were hints of
      rude, Godless force and gaiety&mdash;allusions to the Jenny Lind Theatre,
      the El Dorado, which she apprehended as a name of evil import, and to the
      excursions they would make to Boston or as far as New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason, too, she realized, must have developed; and California, she feared,
      might have emphasized exactly such traits as she would wish suppressed.
      The power of self-destruction in the human heart she believed
      immeasurable. All, all, must throw themselves in abject humility upward
      upon the Rock of Salvation. And she could find nothing humble in Jason's
      periods, burdened as they were with a patent satisfaction in the success
      of his venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet parallel with this was a gladness that he had triumphed, and that he
      was coming back to Cottarsport a figure of importance. She could measure
      that by the attitude of their town, by the number and standing of the
      people who cordially stopped her on the street for the purposes of
      congratulation and curiosity. Every one, of course, had known of their
      engagement; there had been a marked interest when Jason and a fellow
      townsman, Thomas Gast, had departed; but that would be insignificant
      compared to the permanent bulk Jason must now assume. Why he and the
      Canderays would be Cottarsport's most considerable people.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, at the merest thought of the Canderays, personal facts were
      suspended for a mental glance at that separate family. There was no sense
      of inferiority in Olive's mind, but an instinctive feeling of difference.
      This wasn't the result of their big house, nor because the Captain's wife
      had been a member of Boston society, but resided in the contrariness of
      the family itself, now centered in Honora, the only one alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Honora's diversity lay in the fact that, while she seldom actually
      left Cottarsport, it was easy to see that she had a part in a life far
      beyond anything Olive, whose consciousness was strictly limited to one
      narrow place, knew. She always suggested a wider and more elegantly
      finished existence than that of local sociables and church activities.
      Captain Ithiel Canderay, a member of a Cottarsport family long since moved
      away, had, from obscure surprising promptings, returned at his successful
      retirement from the sea, and built his impressive dwelling in the grey
      community. He had always, however different the tradition of his wife's
      attitude, entered with a candid spirit into the interests and life of the
      town, where he had inspired solid confidence in a domineering but
      unimpeachable integrity. Such small civic honors as the locality had to
      bestow were his, and were discharged to the last and most exacting degree.
      But there had been perpetually about him the aloof air of the
      quarter-deck, his tones had never lost the accent of command; and, while
      Cottarsport bitterly guarded its personal equality and independence, it
      took a certain pride in a recognition of the Captain's authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this had unquestionably descended upon Honora; her position
      was made and zealously guarded by the town. Yet that alone failed to hold
      the reason for Olive's feeling; it was at once more particular and more
      all-embracing, and largely feminine. She was almost contemptuous of the
      other's delicacy of person, of the celebrated fact that Honora Canderay
      never turned her hand to the cooking of a dish or the sweeping of a stair;
      and at the same time these very things lifted her apart from Olive's
      commonplace round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind turned again to herself and Jason's home-coming. He had been
      wonderfully generous in his written promises to Rhoda and Jem; and he
      would be equally thoughtful of Hester, she was certain of that. People had
      a way of overlooking Hester, a faithful and, for all her talk, a Christian
      character. Rhoda would study to be a singer; striving, Olive hoped, to put
      what talent she had to a sanctioned use; and Jem, a remarkably vigorous
      and able boy of eighteen, would command his own fishing schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheet-iron stove glowed cherry red with the energy of its heat, and a
      blast of wind rushed against the windows. The wind, she recognized, had
      steadily grown in force; and Olive thought of her father in the barque <i>Emerald</i>
      of Salem, somewhere between Richmond and the home port.... The lamplight
      swelled and diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got a new pleasure from the conjunction of her surrender to matrimony
      and the good it would bring the others; that&mdash;self-sacrifice&mdash;was
      excellence; such subjection of the pride of the flesh was the essence of
      her service. Then some mundane affairs invaded her mind: a wedding dress,
      the preparation of food for a small company after the ceremony, whether
      she should like having a servant. Jason would insist on that; and there
      she decided in the negative. She wouldn't be put upon in her own kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arrangements for the night were complete, and she set the stove door
      slightly open, shivering in her coarse night dress before the icy cold
      drifts of wind in the room, extinguished the lamp, and, after long,
      conscientiously deliberate prayers, got into bed. The wind boomed about
      the house, rattling all the sashes. Its force now seemed to be buffeting
      her heart until she got a measure of release from the thought of the
      granite boulder in the side yard, changeless and immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was gusty, with a coldly blue and cloudless sky. Olive,
      reaching the top of Orange Street, was whipped with dust, her hoops
      flattened grotesquely against her body. The town fell away on either hand,
      lying in a half moon on its harbor. The latter, as blue and bright as the
      sky, was formed by the rocky arm of Cottar's Neck, thrust out into the sea
      and bent from right to left. Most of the fishing fleet showed their bare
      spars at the wharves, but one, a minute fleck of white canvas, was beating
      her way through the Narrows. She wondered, descending, if it were Jem
      coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive was going to the Burrages'; it was possible that they had had a
      later letter than hers from Jason. It might be he would arrive that very
      day. She was conscious of her heart throbbing slightly at this
      possibility, but from a complexity of emotions which still left her uneasy
      if faintly exhilarated. She crossed the courthouse square, where she saw
      that the green grass had become brown, apparently over night, and turned
      into Marlboro Street. Here the houses were more recent than the Staneses';
      they were four square, with a full second story&mdash;a series of detached
      white blocks with flat porticoes&mdash;each set behind a wood fence in a
      lawn with flower borders or twisted and tree-like lilacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the Burrage dwelling without the formality of knocking; and,
      familiar with the household, passed directly through a narrow, darkened
      hall, on which all the doors were closed, to the dining room and kitchen
      beyond. As she had known he would be, Hazzard Burrage was seated with his
      feet, in lamb's wool slippers, thrust under the stove. For the rest, but
      lacking his coat, he was formally and completely dressed; his corded
      throat was folded in a formal black stock, a watch chain and seal hung
      across his waistcoat. Mrs. Burrage was occupied in lining a cupboard with
      fresh shelf paper with a cut lace border. She was a small woman, with
      quick exact movements and an impatient utterance; but her husband was slow&mdash;a
      man who deliberately studied the world with a deep-set gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might have heard,&rdquo; Olive stated directly, on the edge of a
      painted split-hickory chair. They hadn't, Mrs. Burrage informed her: &ldquo;I
      expect he'll just come walking in. That's the way he always did things,
      and I guess California, or anywhere else, won't change him to notice it.
      And when he does,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;he's going to be put out with Hazzard.
      I told you Jason sent us three thousand dollars to get the front of the
      house fixed up. He said he didn't want to find his father sitting in the
      kitchen when he got back. Jason said we were to burn three or four stoves
      all at once. But he won't, and that's all there is to it. Why, he just put
      the money in the bank and there it lies. I read him the parable about the
      talents, but it didn't stir him an inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason always was quick acting,&rdquo; Hazzard Burrage declared; &ldquo;he never
      stopped to consider; and it's as like as not he'll need that money. It
      wouldn't surprise me if when he sat down and counted what he had Jason'd
      find it was less than he thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote me,&rdquo; Olive stated, &ldquo;that we could build a house as big as the
      Canderays'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason always was one to talk,&rdquo; Mrs. Burrage replied in defense of her
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive moved over to the older woman and held the dishes to be replaced in
      the cupboard. They commented on the force of the wind throughout the
      night. &ldquo;The tail end of a blow at sea,&rdquo; Bur-rage told them; &ldquo;I wouldn't
      wonder but it reached right down to the West Indies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he brings me a grey satinet pelerine like I wrote,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Burrage. She was obviously flushed at the thought of the possession of
      such a garment&mdash;a fact which Olive felt, at the other's age, to be
      inappropriate to the not distant solemnity of the Christian ordeal of
      death. She repeated automatically: &ldquo;... turn from these vanities unto the
      living God.&rdquo; She rose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you know if I hear anything, and anyhow stop in tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, sere leaves were whirling in grey funnels of dust, the intense
      blue bay sparkled under the cobalt sky; and, leaving Marlboro Street with
      a hand on her bonnet, she ran directly into Honora Canderay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Olive exclaimed, breathless and slightly concerned. &ldquo;Indeed if I saw
      you, Honora; the wind was that strong pulling at a person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; Honora replied. She was wrapped from throat to hem
      in a cinnamon colored velvet cloak that, fluttering, showed a lining of
      soft, quilted yellow. In the flood of morning her skin was flawless; her
      delicate lips and hazel eyes held the faint mockery that was the visible
      sign of her disturbing quality. She laid a hand, in a short, furred kid
      glove, on Olive's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so pleased about Jason's success,&rdquo; she continued, in a clear
      insistent voice. &ldquo;You must be mad with anxiety to have him back. It's the
      most romantic thing in the world. Aren't you thrilled to the soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to&mdash;to know he's been preserved,&rdquo; Olive stammered, confused
      by Honora's frank speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sound exactly as if he were a jar of quinces,&rdquo; the other answered
      impatiently; &ldquo;and not a true lover coming back from California with bags
      of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive's confusion deepened to painful embarrassment at the indelicate term
      lover. She wondered, hotly red, how Honora could go on so, and made a
      motion to continue on her way. But the other's fingers closed and held
      her. &ldquo;I wonder, Olive,&rdquo; she said more thoughtfully, &ldquo;if I know you well
      enough, if you will allow me, to give you some advice. It is this&mdash;don't
      be too rigid with Jason when he gets back. For nearly ten years he's been
      out in a life very different from Cottarsport, and he must have changed in
      that time. Here we stay almost the same&mdash;ten or twenty or fifty years
      is nothing really. The fishing boats come in, they may have different
      names, but they are the same. We stop and talk, Honora Canderay and Olive
      Stanes, and years before and years later women will stand here and do the
      same with beliefs no wider than your finger. But it isn't like that
      outside; and Jason will have that advantage of us&mdash;things really very
      small, but which have always seemed tremendous here, will mean no more to
      him than they are worth. He will be careless, perhaps, of your most
      cherished ideas; and, if you are to meet him fairly, you must try to see
      through his eyes as well as your own. Truly I want you to be happy, Olive;
      I want every one in Cottarsport to be as happy... as they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive's embarrassment increased: it was impossible to know what Honora
      Canderay meant by her last words, in that echoing voice. Nevertheless, her
      independence of spirit, the long nourished tenets of the abhorrence of
      sin, asserted themselves in the face of even Honora's directions. &ldquo;I
      trust,&rdquo; she replied stiffly, &ldquo;that Jason has been given grace to walk in
      the path of God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped with lips parted, her breath
      laboring with shock, at the interruption pronounced in ringing accents.
      Honora Canderay said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace be damned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive backed away with her hands pressed to her cheeks. In the midst of
      her shuddering surprise she realized how much the other resembled her
      father, the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Honora further ventured, &ldquo;that you are looking for a bolt of
      lightning, but it is late in the season for that. There are no thunder
      storms to speak of after September.&rdquo; She turned abruptly, and Olive
      watched her depart, gracefully swaying against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All Olive's unformed opinions and attitude concerning Honora Canderay
      crystallized into one sharp, intelligible feeling&mdash;dislike. The
      breadth of being which the other had seemed to possess was now revealed as
      nothing more than a lack of reverence. She was inexpressibly upset by
      Honora's profanity, the blasphemous mind it exhibited, her attempted
      glossing of sin. It was nothing less. In the assault on Olive's most
      fundamental verities&mdash;the contempt which, she divined, had been
      offered to the edifice of her conscience and creed&mdash;she responded
      blindly, instinctively, with an overwhelming condemnation. At the same
      time she was frightened, and hurried away from the proximity of such
      unsanctified talk. She did not go to Citron Street, and the shops, as she
      had intended; but kept directly on until she found herself at the harbor
      and wharves. The latter serrated the water's edge, projecting from the
      relatively tall, bald warehouses, reeking with the odor of dead fish, cut
      open and laid in salt, grey-white areas to the sun and wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small group of men, with flat bronzed countenances and rough furze
      coats, uneasily stirred their hats, in the local manner of saluting women,
      and turned to gaze fixedly at her as she passed. Even in her perturbation
      of mind she was conscious of their unusual scrutiny. She couldn't, now,
      for the life of her, recall what needed to be bought; and, mounting the
      narrow uneven way from the water, she proceeded home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some towels, laid on the boulder to dry, had not been sufficiently
      weighted, and hung blown and crumpled on a lilac bush. These she
      collected, rearranged, complaining of the blindness of whoever might be
      about the house, and then proceeded within. There, to her amazement, she
      found Hester, in the middle of the morning, and Rhoda bent over the dinner
      table, sobbing into her arm. Hester met her with a drawn face darkly
      smudged beneath the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Emerald</i> was lost off the Cape,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;sunk with all on
      board. A man came over from Salem to tell us. He had to go right back. Pa,
      he's lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive sank into a chair with limp hands. Rhoda continued uninterrupted her
      sobbing, while Hester went on with her recital in a thin, blank voice.
      &ldquo;The ship <i>J. Q. Adams</i> stood by the <i>Emerald</i>, but there was
      such a sea running she couldn't do anything else. They just had to see the
      <i>Emerald</i>, with the men in the rigging, go under. That's what he said
      who was here. They just had to see Pa drown before their eyes.... The wind
      was something terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep, dry sorrow constricted Olive's, heart. Suddenly the details of
      packing her father's blue sea chest returned to her mind&mdash;the wool
      socks she had knitted and carefully folded in the bottom, the needles and
      emery and thread stowed in their scarlet bag, the tin of goose grease for
      his throat, the Bible that had been shipped so often. She thought of them
      all scattered and rent in the wild sea, of her father&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She forced herself to rise, with a set face, and put her hand on Rhoda's
      shoulder. &ldquo;It's right to mourn, like Rachel, but don't forget the majesty
      of God.&rdquo; Rhoda shook off her palm and continued in an ecstasy of emotional
      relief. Olive hardened. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; she commanded; &ldquo;we must fix things here,
      for the neighbors and Pastor will be in. I wish Jem were back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Rhoda became even more unrestrained, and Olive remembered that Jem
      too was at sea, and that probably he had been caught in the same gale.
      &ldquo;He'll be all right,&rdquo; she added quickly; &ldquo;the fishing boats live through
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was infinitely relieved when, two days later, Jem arrived safely
      home. He came into the house with a pounding of heavy boots, a powerfully
      built youth with a rugged jaw and an intent quiet gaze. &ldquo;I heard at the
      wharf,&rdquo; he told Olive. They were in the kitchen, and he pulled off his
      boots and set them away from the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thankful you're so steady and able,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad Jason's coming home&mdash;rich,&rdquo; he replied tersely. Later,
      after supper, while they still sat at the table, he went on, &ldquo;There is a
      fine yawl for sale at Ipswich, sails ain't been made a year, fifty-five
      tons; I could do right good with that. The fishing's never been better. Do
      you think Jason would be content to buy her, Olive? I could pay him back
      after a run or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you he'd do something like that,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I guess now it
      wouldn't mean much to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll be away,&rdquo; Rhoda eagerly added; &ldquo;you wouldn't have to give me
      anything, Jem. Jason promised me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unreasonable and disturbing sense of insecurity enveloped Olive. But,
      of course, it would be all right&mdash;Jason was coming back rich, to
      marry her. Jem would have the yawl and Rhoda get away to study singing.
      And yet all that she vaguely dreaded about Jason himself persisted darkly
      at the back of her consciousness, augmented by Honora Canderay's warning.
      She was a little afraid of Jason, too; in a way, after so long, he seemed
      like a stranger, a stranger whom she was going to wed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be all dressed up,&rdquo; Rhoda stated. &ldquo;I hope, Olive, you will kiss him
      as soon as he steps through the door. I know I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so shameless, Rhoda,&rdquo; the elder admonished her. &ldquo;You are very
      indelicate. I'd never think of kissing Jason like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go over and see the man who owns her,&rdquo; Jem said enigmatically.
      &ldquo;She's a cockpit boat, but I heard the wave wasn't made that could fill
      her. And we have my share of the last run till Jason's here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paid this faithfully into Olive's hand the next day and then
      disappeared. She thought he came through the door again: someone stood
      behind her. Olive turned slowly and saw an impressive figure in stiff
      black broadcloth and an incredibly high glassy silk hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew instinctively that it must be Jason Burrage, and yet the feeling
      of strangeness persisted. All sense of the time which had elapsed since
      Jason went was lost in the illusion that the figure familiar to her
      through years of knowledge and association had instantly, by a species of
      magic, been transformed into the slightly smiling, elaborate man in the
      doorway. She stepped backward, hesitatingly pronouncing his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olive,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a deep, satisfied breath, &ldquo;it hasn't changed a
      particle!&rdquo; To her extreme relief he did not make a move to embrace her;
      but gazed intently about the room. One of the things that made him seem
      different, she realized, was the rim of whiskers framing his lower face.
      She became conscious of details of his appearance&mdash;baggy dove-colored
      trousers over glazed boots, a quince yellow waistcoat in diamond pattern,
      a cluster of seals. Then her attention was held by his countenance, and
      she saw that his clothes were only an insignificant part of his real
      difference from the man she had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason Burrage had always had a set will, the reputation of an impatient,
      even ugly disposition. This had been marked by a sultry lip and flickering
      eye; but now, though his expression was noticeably quieter, it gave her
      the impression of a glittering and dangerous reserve; his masklike calm
      was totally other than the mobile face she had known. Then, too, he had
      grown much older&mdash;she swiftly computed his age: it could not be more
      than forty-two, yet his hair was thickly stained with grey, lines starred
      the comers of his eyes and drew faintly at his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad to see me, Olive?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jason, what an unnecessary question. Of course I am, more thankful
      than I can say for your safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked across the hills from the Dumner stage,&rdquo; he proceeded. &ldquo;It was
      something to see Cottarsport on its bay and the Neck and the fishing boats
      at Planger's wharf. I'd like to have an ounce of gold for every time I
      thought about it and pictured it and you. Out on the placers of the
      Calaveras, or the Feather, I got to believing there wasn't any such town,
      but here it is.&rdquo; He advanced toward her; she realized that she was about
      to be kissed, and a painful color dyed her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll stop for supper,&rdquo; she said practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been home yet, I came right here; I'll see them and be back.
      I'll bet I find them in the kitchen, with the front stoves cold, in spite
      of what I wrote and sent. I brought you a present, just for fun, and I'll
      leave it now, since it's heavy.&rdquo; He bent over a satchel at his feet and
      got a buckskin bag, bigger than his two fists, which he dropped with a
      dull thud on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Jason?&rdquo; she asked. But of herself she knew the answer. He
      untied a string, and, dipping in his fingers, showed her a fine yellow
      metallic trickle. &ldquo;Gold dust, two tumblers full,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We used to
      measure it that way&mdash;a pinch a dollar, teaspoonful to the ounce, a
      wineglass holds a hundred, and a tumbler a thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was breathless before the small shapeless pouch that held such a
      staggering amount. He laughed. &ldquo;Why, Olive, it's nothing at all. I just
      brought it like that so you could see how we carried it in California. We
      are all rich now, Olive&mdash;the Burrages, and you're one, and the
      Staneses. I have close to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sum was little more to her than a fable, a thing beyond the scope of
      her comprehension; but the two thousand dollars before her gaze was a
      miracle made manifest. There it was to study, feel; subconsciously she
      inserted her hand in the bag, into the cold, smooth particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and fifty thousand,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;but if you think I didn't
      work for it, if you suppose I picked it right out of a pan on the river
      bars, why&mdash;why, you are wrong.&rdquo; Words failed him to express the
      erroneousness of such conclusions. &ldquo;I slaved like a Mexican,&rdquo; he added;
      &ldquo;and in bad luck almost to the end.&rdquo; She sat and gazed at him with an
      easier air and a growing interest, her hands clasped in her lap. &ldquo;What I
      didn't know when I left Cottarsport was wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, take the mining,&rdquo; he said with a gesture; &ldquo;I mean the bowl mining at
      first... just the heavy work in it killed off most of the prospectors&mdash;all
      day with a big iron pan, half full of clay and gravel, sloshing about in
      those rivers. And maybe you'd work a month without a glimmer, waking wet
      and cold under the sierras, whirling the pan round and round; and maybe
      when you had the iron cleared out with a magnet, and dropped in the
      quicksilver, what gold was there wouldn't amalgam. I can tell you, Olive,
      only the best, or the hardest, came through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a blunt, tapering cigar and lighted it expansively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lonely and dangerous business: every one carried his dust right on his
      body, and there were plenty would risk a shot at a miner coming back
      solitary with his donkey and his pile. It got better when the new methods
      came, and we used a rocker-hollowed out of a log. Then four of us went in
      partnership&mdash;one to dig the gravel, one to carry it to the cradle,
      another to keep it rocking, and the last to pour in the water. Then we
      drawed off the gold and sand through a plug hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did fine at that,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and in the fall of 'Fifty cleaned up
      eighteen thousand apiece. Then we had an argument: we were in the Yuba
      country, where it was kind of bad; two of us, and I was one of them, said
      to divide the dust, and get out best we could; but the others wanted to
      send all the gold to San Francisco in charge of one of them and a man who
      was going down with more dust. We finally agreed to this and lost every
      ounce we'd mined. The escort said they were shot by some of the disbanded
      California army, but I'm not sure. It seemed to me like our two had met
      somewhere, killed the other, and got the gold to rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Jason!&rdquo; Olive exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was nothing,&rdquo; he said complacently; &ldquo;but only a joker to start with.
      I did a lot of things then to get a new outfit&mdash;sold peanuts on the
      Plaza in 'Frisco, or hollered the New York <i>Tribune</i> at a dollar and
      a half a copy; I washed glasses in a saloon and drove mules. After that I
      took a steamer for Stocton and the Calaveras. You ought to have seen
      Stocton, Olive&mdash;board shanties and blanket houses and tents, with two
      thieves left hanging on a gallows. We went from there, a party of us, for
      the north bank of the Calaveras, tramping in dust so hot that it scorched
      your face. Sluicing had just started and long Toms&mdash;a long Tom is a
      short placer&mdash;so we didn't know much about it. Looking back I can see
      the gold was there; but after working right up to the end of the season we
      had no more than a couple of thousand apiece. There were too many of us to
      start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I drifted back to San Francisco.&rdquo; He paused, and the expression
      which had most disturbed her deepened on his countenance, a stillness like
      the marble of a gravestone guarding implacable secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;San Francisco is different from Cottarsport, Olive,&rdquo; he said after a
      little. &ldquo;Here you wouldn't believe there was such a place; and there
      Cottarsport seemed too safe to be true... Well, I went after it again,
      this time as far north as Shasta. I prospected from the Shasta country
      south, and got a good lump together again. By then placer mining was
      better understood; we had sluice boxes two or three hundred feet long,
      connected with the streams, with strips nailed across the bottom where the
      gold and sand settled as the water ran through. Yes, I did well; and then
      fluming began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;is damming a river around its bed and washing the
      opened gravel. It takes a lot of money, a lot of work and men; and
      sometimes it pays big, and often it doesn't. I guess there were fifty of
      us at it. We slaved all the dry season at the dam and flume, a big wood
      course for the stream; we had wing dams for the placers and ditches, and
      the best prospects for eight or ten weeks' washing. It was early in
      September when we were ready to start, and on a warm afternoon I said to
      an old pardner, 'What do you make out of those big, black clouds settling
      on the peaks?' He took one look&mdash;the wind was a steady and muggy
      southwester&mdash;and then he sat down and cried. The tears rolled right
      over his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the rains, nearly two months early, and the next day dams, flume,
      boards, and hope boiled down past us in a brown mash. That left me poorer
      than I'd ever been before; I had more when I was home on the wharves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she interrupted him, rising; &ldquo;if you're coming back to supper I
      must put the draught on the stove.&rdquo; From the kitchen she heard him singing
      in a low, contented voice:=
    </p>
    <p>
                "'The pilot bread was in my mouth,
    </p>
    <p>
                The gold dust in my eye,
    </p>
    <p>
                And though from you I'm far away,
    </p>
    <p>
                Dear Anna, don't you cry!'&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      Then:=
    </p>
    <p>
                "'Oh, Ann Eliza!
    </p>
    <p>
                Don't you cry for me.
    </p>
    <p>
                I'm going to Calaveras
    </p>
    <p>
                With my wash bowl on my knee.'&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned and resumed her position with her hands folded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; Jason Burrage told her, &ldquo;was how I learned gold mining in
      California. I sank shafts, too, and worked a windlass till the holes got
      so deep they had to be timbered and the ore needed a crusher. But after
      the fluming I knew what to wait for. I kept going in a sort of commerce
      for a while&mdash;buying old outfits and selling them again to the late
      comers&mdash;a pick or shovel would bring ten dollars and long boots fifty
      dollars a pair. I got twenty-four dollars for a box of Seidlitz powders.
      Then in 'Fifty-four I went in with three scientific men&mdash;one had been
      a big chemist at Paris&mdash;and things took a turn. We had the dead wood
      on gold. Why, we did nothing but re-travel the American Fork and Indian
      Bar, the Casumnec and Moquelumne, and work the tailings the earlier miners
      had piled up and left, just like I had south. We did some pretty things
      with cyanide; yes, and hydraulics and powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things took a turn,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;investments in stampers and so on, and
      here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he had gone&mdash;supper, she had informed him, was at five exactly&mdash;Olive
      had the bewildered feeling of partially waking from an extraordinary
      dream. Yet the buckskin bag on the table possessed a weighty actuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for a long while gazing intently at the gold, which, like a
      crystal ball, held for her varied reflections. Then, recalling the
      exigencies of the kitchen, she hurried abruptly away. Her thoughts wheeled
      about Jason Burrage in a confusion of all the impressions she had ever had
      of him. But try as she might she could not picture the present man as a
      part of her life in Cottarsport; she could not see herself married to him,
      although that event waited just beyond today. She set her lips in a
      straight line, a fixed purpose gave her courage in place of the timidity
      inspired by Jason's opulent strangeness&mdash;she couldn't allow herself
      to be turned aside for a moment from the way of righteousness. The gods of
      mammon, however they might blackly assault her spirit, should be
      confounded.=
    </p>
    <p>
                &rdquo;... hide me
    </p>
    <p>
                Till the storm of life is past."=
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang in a high quavering voice. There was a stir beyond&mdash;surely
      Jason wasn't back so soon; but it was Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's on the table here?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let that be,&rdquo; she cried back in a panic at having left the gift so
      exposed. &ldquo;That's gold dust; Jason brought it, two thousand dollars'
      worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged whistle followed her announcement. Jem appeared with the
      buckskin bag in his hand. &ldquo;Why, here's two yawls right in my hand,&rdquo; he
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind one thing, Jem,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;he's coming back for supper, and I
      won't have you and Rhoda at him about boats and singing the minute he's in
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rhoda, with exclamations, and then Hester, inspected the gold. &ldquo;I'd slave
      five years for that,&rdquo; the latter stated, &ldquo;and then hardly get it; and here
      you, have it for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get the good of it too, Hester,&rdquo; Olive told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll just work for what I get,&rdquo; she replied fiercely. &ldquo;I won't take a
      penny from Jason, Olive Stanes; you can't hold that over me, and the
      sooner you both know it the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to pray to be saved from pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask benefits from any one,&rdquo; Hester stoutly observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Olive commenced, scandalized, but she stopped at
      Jason's entrance. &ldquo;Hester she wanted a share of the gold,&rdquo; Jem declared
      with a light in his slow gaze, &ldquo;and Olive was cursing at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots more,&rdquo; said Jason Burrage, &ldquo;buckets full.&rdquo; In spite of the efforts
      of every one to be completely at ease the supper was unavoidably stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Jason had lighted one of his blunt cigars, and begun a vivid
      description of western life, the Staneses were transported by the marvels
      following one upon another: a nugget had been picked up over a foot long,
      it weighed a hundred and ninety pounds, and realized forty-three thousand
      dollars. &ldquo;Why, fifty and seventy-five lumps were common,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;At
      Ford's Bar a man took out seven hundred dollars a day for near a month.
      Another found seventeen thousand dollars in a gutter two or three feet
      deep and not a hundred yards long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But 'Frisco was the place; you could see it spread in a day with
      warehouses on the water and tents climbing up every hill. Happy Valley, on
      the beach, couldn't hold another rag house. The Parker House rented for a
      hundred and seventy thousand a year, and most of it paid for gambling
      privileges; monté and faro, blazing lights and brass bands everywhere and
      dancing in the El Dorado saloon. At first the men danced with each other,
      but later&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped; an awkward silence followed. Olive was rigid with inarticulate
      protest, a sense of outrage&mdash;gambling, saloons, and dancing! All that
      she had feared about Jason became more concrete, more imminent. She saw
      California as a modern Babylon, a volcano of gold and vice; already she
      had heard of great fires that had devastated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't mine on Sunday, Olive,&rdquo; Jason assured her; &ldquo;and all the boys
      went to the preaching and sang the hymns, standing out on the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hester, finally, with a muttered period, rose and disappeared; Jem went
      out to consult with a man, his nod to Olive spoke of yawls; and Rhoda, at
      last, reluctantly made her way above. Olive's uneasiness increased when
      she found herself alone with the man she was to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like Rhoda and Jem hearing about all that wickedness,&rdquo; she told
      Jason Burrage; &ldquo;they are young and easy affected. Rhoda gives me a lot of
      worry as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we forget them,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I haven't had a word with you
      yet; that is, about ourselves. I don't even know but you have gone and
      fell in love with some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;how can you? I told you I'd marry you, and I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad to see me?&rdquo; he demanded, coming closer and capturing her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what a question. Of course I'm pleased you're back and safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't got a headache, have you?&rdquo; he inquired jocularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied seriously. His words, his manners, his grasp, worried
      her more and more. Still, she reminded herself, she must be patient,
      accept life as it had been ordained. There was a slight flutter at her
      heart, a constriction of her throat; and she wondered if this were love.
      She should, she felt, exhibit more warmth at Jason's return, the
      preservation, through such turbulent years of absence, of her image. But
      it was beyond her power to force her hand to return his pressure: her
      fingers lay still and cool in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the same, Olive,&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;and I'm glad you're what you
      are, and that Cottarsport is what it is. That's why I came back: it was in
      my blood, the old town and you. All the time I kept thinking of when I'd
      come back rich as I made up my mind to be, and get you what you ought to
      have&mdash;be of some importance in Cottarsport, like the Canderays. The
      old captain, too, died while I was away. How's Honora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora Canderay is an ungodly woman,&rdquo; Olive asserted with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I always kind of liked
      to look at her. She reminded me of a schooner with everything set coming
      up brisk into the wind.&rdquo; Olive made a motion toward the stove, but he
      restrained her; rising, he put in fresh wood. Then he turned and again
      seemed lost in a long, contented inspection of the quiet interior. Olive
      saw that marks of weariness shadowed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I came back for,&rdquo; he reiterated; &ldquo;peaceful as the forests,
      and yet warm and human. Blood counts.&rdquo; He returned to his place by her,
      and leaned forward, very earnestly. &ldquo;California isn't real the way this
      is,&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;the women were just paint and powder, like things you
      would see in a fever, and then you'd wake up, in Cottarsport, well again,
      with you, Olive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She managed to smile at him in acknowledgment of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm desperately glad I pulled through without many scars. But there are
      some, Olive; that was bound to be. I don't know if a man had better say
      anything about the past, or just let it be, and go on. Times I think one
      and then the other. Yet you are so calm sitting here, and so good, it
      would be a big help to tell you... Olive, out on the American, and God
      knows how sorry I've been, I killed a man, Olive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she felt herself turning icy cold, except for the hot blood rushing
      into her head. She stared at him for a moment, horrified; and then
      mechanically drew back, scraping the chair across the floor. Perhaps she
      hadn't understood, but certainly he had said&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I tell what I can for myself,&rdquo; he hurried on, following her.
      &ldquo;It was when the four of us were working with a rocker. I was shoveling
      the gravel, and every one in California knows that when you're doing that,
      and find a nugget over half an ounce, it belongs to you personal and not
      to the partnership. Well, I came on a big one, and laid it away&mdash;they
      all saw it&mdash;and then this Eddie Lukens hid it out on me. He was the
      only one near where I had it; he broke it up and put it in the cradle,
      sure; and in the talk that followed I&mdash;I shot him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid a detaining hand on her shoulder, but she wrenched herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch me!&rdquo; she breathed. She thought she saw him bathed in the
      blood of the man he had slain. Her lips formed a sentence, &ldquo;'Thou shalt
      not kill.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was tried at Spanish Bar,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Miners' law is better than
      you hear in the East. It's quick, it has to be, but in the main it's
      serious and right. I was tried with witnesses and a jury and they let me
      off; they justified me. That ought to go for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't come near me,&rdquo; she cried, choking, filled with dread and utter
      loathing. &ldquo;How can you stand there and&mdash;stand there, a murderer, with
      a life on your heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face quivered with concern; in spite of her words he drew near her
      again, repeating the fact that he had been judged, released. Olive Stanes'
      hysteria vanished before the cold stability which came to her assistance,
      the sense of being rooted in her creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thou shalt not kill,'&rdquo; she echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotion faded from his features, his countenance once more became
      masklike, the jaw was hard and sharp, his eyes narrowed. &ldquo;It's all over
      then?&rdquo; he asked. She nodded, her lips pinched into a white line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else could be hoped? Blood guiltiness. O Jason, pray to save your
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved over to where his high silk hat reposed, secured it, and turned.
      &ldquo;This will be final.&rdquo; His voice was hard. Olive stood slightly swaying,
      with closed eyes. Then she remembered the buckskin bag of not yellow but
      scarlet gold. She stumbled forward to it and thrust the weight into his
      hand. Jason Burrage's fingers closed on the gift, while his gaze rested on
      her from under contracted brows. He was, it seemed, about to speak, but
      instead preserved an intense silence; he looked once more about the room,
      still and old in its lamplight. Why didn't he go? Then she saw that she
      was alone:
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the eternal rock outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      From above came the clear, joyous voice of Rhoda singing. Olive crumpled
      into a chair. Soon Jem would be back.... She turned and slipped down upon
      the floor in an agony of prayer.

    <h2>
      HONORA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ONORA CANDERAY saw
      Jason Burrage on the day after his arrival in Cotarsport: he was walking
      through the town with a set, inattentive countenance; and, although she
      was in the carriage and leaned forward, speaking in her ringing voice, it
      was evident that he had not noticed her. She thought his expression gloomy
      for a man returned with a fortune to his marriage. Honora still dwelt upon
      him as she slowly progressed through the capricious streets and mounted
      toward the hills beyond. He presented, she decided, an extraordinary, even
      faintly comic, appearance in Cottarsport, with a formal black coat open on
      a startling waistcoat and oppressive gold chain, pale trousers and a silk
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such clothes, theatrical in effect, were inevitable to his changed
      condition and necessarily stationary taste. Yet, considering, she shifted
      the theatrical to dramatic: in an obscure but palpable manner Jason did
      not seem cheap. He never had in the past And now, while his inappropriate
      overdressing in the old town of loose and weathered raiment brought a
      smile to her firm lips, there was still about him the air which from the
      beginning had made him more noticeable than his fellows. It had even been
      added to&mdash;by the romance of his journey and triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly realized that, by chance, she had stumbled on the one term
      which more than any other might contain Jason. Romantic. Yes, that was the
      explanation of his power to stir always an interest in him, vaguely
      suggest such possibilities as he had finally accomplished, the venture to
      California and return with gold and the complicated watch chain. She had
      said no more to him than to the other Cottarsport youth and young manhood,
      perhaps a dozen sentences in a year; but the others merged into a
      composite image of fuzzy chins, reddened knuckles, and inept, choked
      speech, and Jason Burrage remained a slightly sullen individual with
      potentialities. He had never stayed long in her mind, or had any actual
      part in her life&mdash;her mother's complete indifference to Cottarsport
      had put a barrier between its acutely independent spirit and the Canderays&mdash;but
      she had been easily conscious of his special quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in itself was no novelty to her experience of a metropolitan and
      distinguished society: what now kept Jason in her thoughts was the fact
      that he had made his capability serve his mood; he had taken himself out
      into the world and there, with what he was, succeeded. His was not an
      ineffectual condition&mdash;a longing, a possibility that, without the
      power of accomplishment, degenerated into a mere attitude of bitterness.
      Just such a state, for example, as enveloped herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had climbed out of Cottarsport, to the crown of the height
      under which it lay, and Honora ordered Coggs, a coachman decrepit with
      age, to stop. She half turned and looked down over the town with a veiled,
      introspective gaze. From here it was hardly more than a narrow rim of
      roofs about the bright water, broken by the white bulk of her dwelling and
      the courthouse square. The hills, turning roundly down, were sere and
      showed everywhere the grey glint of rock; Cottar's Neck already appeared
      wintry; a diminished wind, drawing in through the Narrows, flattened the
      smoke of the chimneys below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cottarsport! The word, with all its implications, was so vivid in her mind
      that she thought she must have spoken it aloud. Cottarsport and the
      Canderays&mdash;now one solitary woman. She wondered again at the curious
      and involved hold the locality had upon her; its tyranny over her birth
      and destiny. It was comparatively easy to understand the influence the
      place had exerted on her father: commencing with his sixteenth year, his
      life had been spent, until his retirement from the sea, in arduous voyages
      to far ports and cities. His first command&mdash;the anchor had been
      weighed on his twentieth birthday&mdash;had been of a brig to Zanzibar for
      a cargo of gum copal; his last a storm-battered journey about, apparently,
      all the perilous capes of the world. Then he had been near fifty, and the
      space between was a continuous record of struggle with savage and
      faithless peoples, strange latitudes and currents, and burdensome
      responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, too, presented no insuperable obstacle to a sufficient
      comprehension&mdash;a noted beauty in a gay and self-indulgent society,
      she had passed through a triumphant period without forming any attachment.
      An inordinate amount of champagne had been uncorked in her honor,
      compliment and service and offers had made up her daily round; until,
      almost impossibly exacting, she had found herself beyond her early
      radiance, in the first tragic realization of decline. Stopping, perhaps,
      in the midst of slipping her elegance of body into a party dress, she
      remembered that she was thirty-five&mdash;just Honora's age at present.
      The compliments and offers had lessened, she was in a state of weary
      revulsion when Ithiel Canderay&mdash;bronzed and despotic and rich&mdash;had
      appeared before her and, the following day, urged marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was easy to see why the shipmaster, desirous of peace after the
      unpeaceful sea, should build his house in the still, old port the
      tradition of which was in his blood. It was no more difficult to
      understand how his wife, always a little tired now from the beginning ill
      effects of ceaseless balls and wining, should welcome a spacious, quiet
      house and unflagging, patient care.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was clear; and, in a way, it made her own position logical&mdash;she
      was the daughter, the repository, of such varied and yet unified forces.
      In moments of calm, such as this, Honora could be successfully
      philosophical. But she was not always placid; in fact she was placid but
      an insignificant part of her waking hours. She was ordinarily filled with
      emotions that, having no outlet, kept her stirred up, half resentful, and
      half desirous of things which she yet made no extended effort to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora told herself daily that she detested Cot-tarsport, she intended to
      sell her house, give it to the town, and move to Boston. But, after three
      or four weeks in the city, a sense of weariness and nostalgia would
      descend upon her&mdash;the bitterness of her mother lived over again&mdash;and
      drive her back to the place she had left with such decided expressions of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the root of her not large interest in Jason Burrage&mdash;he,
      too, she had always felt, had had possibilities outside the local life and
      fish industry; and he had gone forth and justified, realized, them. He had
      broken away from the enormous pressure of custom, personal habit, and
      taken from life what was his. But she, Honora Canderay, had not had the
      courage to free herself from an existence without incentive, without
      reward. Something of this might commonly find excuse in the fact that she
      was a woman, and that the doors of life and experience, except one, were
      closed to her; but, individually, she had little use for this supine
      attitude. Her blood was too domineering. She consigned such inhibitions to
      pale creatures like Olive Stanes.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun, sinking toward the plum-colored hills on the left, cast a rosy
      glow over low-piled clouds at the far horizon, and the water of the harbor
      seemed scattered with the petals of crimson peonies. The air darkened
      perceptibly. For a moment the grey town on the fading water, the distant
      flushed sky, were charged with the vague unrest of the flickering day.
      Suddenly it was colder, and Honora, drawing up her shawl, sharply
      commanded Coggs to drive on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to fetch Paret Fifield from the steam railway station
      nearest Cottarsport. He visited her at regular intervals&mdash;although
      the usual period had been doubled since she'd seen him&mdash;and asked her
      with unfailing formality to be his wife. Why she hadn't agreed long ago,
      except that Paret was Boston personified, she did not understand. In the
      moments when she fled to the city she always intended to have him come to
      her at once. But hardly had she arrived before her determination would
      waver, and her thoughts automatically, against her will, return to
      Cottarsport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studying him, as they drove back through the early dusk, she was surprised
      that he had been so long-suffering. He was not a patient type of man;
      rather he was the quietly aggressive, suavely selfish example for whom the
      world, success, had been a very simple matter. He was not solemn, either,
      or a recluse, as faithful lovers commonly were; but furnished a leading
      figure in the cotillions and had a nice capacity for wine. She said almost
      complainingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How young and gay you look, Paret, with your lemon verbena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was, it seemed to her, not entirely at ease, and almost confused at her
      statement. Nevertheless, he gave his person a swiftly complacent glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do seem quite well,&rdquo; he agreed surprisingly. &ldquo;Honora, I'm the next
      thing to fifty. Would any one guess it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a new aspect of Paret's, and she studied him keenly, with the
      slightly satirical mouth inherited from her father. Embarrassment became
      evident at his exhibition of trivial pride, and nothing more was said
      until, winding through the gloom of Cottarsport, they had reached her
      house. Inside there was a wide hall with the stair mounting on the right
      under a panelled arch. Mrs. Coz-zens, Honora's aunt and companion, was in
      the drawing room when they entered, and greeted Paret Fifield with the
      simple friendliness which, clearly without disagreeable intent, she
      reserved for an unquestionable few.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, the elder woman winding wool from an ivory swift clamped to
      a table, Honora thought that Paret had never been so vivacious; positively
      he was silly. For no comprehensible reason her mind turned to Jason
      Burrage, striding with a lowered head, in his incongruous clothes, through
      the town of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, Paret,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;if you remember two men who went from
      here to California about ten years ago? Well, one of them is back with his
      pockets full of gold and a silk hat. He was engaged to Olive Stanes... I
      suppose their wedding will happen at any time. You see, he was faithful
      like yourself, Paret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's back was toward her; he was examining, as he had on every visit
      Honora could recall, the curious objects in a lacquered cabinet brought
      from over-seas by Ithiel Canderay, and it was a noticeably long time
      before he turned. Mrs. Cozzens, the shetland converted into a ball, rose
      and announced her intention of retiring; a thin, erect figure in black
      moiré with a long countenance and agate brown eyes, seed pearls, gold band
      bracelets, and a Venise point cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone the silence in the room became oppressive. Honora was
      thinking of her life in connection with Paret Fifield, wondering if she
      could ever bring herself to marry him. She would have to decide soon: it
      seemed incredible that he was nearing fifty. Why, it must have been
      fifteen years ago when he first&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora,&rdquo; he pronounced, leaning forward in his chair, &ldquo;I came prepared to
      tell you a particular thing, but I find it much more difficult than I had
      anticipated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she replied, and her voice, the fact she pronounced, seemed to
      come from a consciousness other than hers; &ldquo;you are going to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said with a deep, relieved sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on a dinner dress looped with a silk ball fringe, and her fingers
      automatically played with the hanging ornaments as she studied him with a
      composed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is she, Paret?&rdquo; Honora asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat in an embarrassed manner. &ldquo;Not quite nineteen, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and her expression grew imperceptibly colder. A slight but
      actual irritation at him, a palpable anger, shocked her, which she was
      careful to screen from her manner and voice. &ldquo;You will be very happy,
      certainly. A young wife would suit you perfectly. You have kept splendidly
      young, Paret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is really a superb creature, Honora,&rdquo; he proceeded gratefully. &ldquo;I
      must bring her to you. But I am going to miss this.&rdquo; He indicated the
      grave chamber in which they sat, the white marble mantel and high mirror,
      the heavy mahogany settled back in half shadow, the dark velvet draperies
      of the large windows sweeping from alabaster cornices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I feel like burning it to the ground,&rdquo; she asserted, rising. &ldquo;I
      would if I could burn all that it signifies, yes, and a great deal of
      myself, too.&rdquo; She raised her arms in a vivid, passionate gesture. &ldquo;Leave
      it all behind and sail up to Java Head and through the Sunda Strait, into
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the difficulty of his announcement Paret Fifield talked with
      animation about his plans and approaching marriage. Honora wondered at the
      swiftness with which she&mdash;for so long a fundamental part of his
      thought&mdash;'had dropped from his mind. It had the aspect of a physical
      act of seclusion, as if a door had been closed upon her, the last,
      perhaps, leading out of her isolation. She hadn't been at all sure that
      she would not marry Paret: today she had almost decided in favor of such a
      consummation of her existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl not quite nineteen! She had been only twenty when Paret Fifield had
      first danced with her. He had been interested immediately. It was
      difficult for her to realize that she was now thirty-five; soon forty
      would be upon her, and then a grey reach. She didn't feel any older than
      she had, well&mdash;on the day that Jason Burrage departed for California.
      There wasn't a line on her face; no trace, yet, of time on her spirit or
      body; but the dust must inevitably settle over her as it did on a vase
      standing unmoved on a shelf. A vase was a tranquil object, well suited to
      glimmer from a corner through a decade; but she was different. The
      heritage of her father's voyaging stirred in her together with the
      negation that held her stationary. A third state, a hot rebellion, poured
      through her, while she listened to Paret's facile periods. Really, he was
      rather ridiculous about the girl. She was conscious of the dull pounding
      of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning following was remarkably warm and still; and, after Paret
      Fifield had gone, Honora made her way slowly down to the bay. The sunlight
      lay like thick yellow dust on the warehouses and docks, and the water
      filled the sweep of Cottar's Neck with a solid and smoothly blue expanse.
      A fishing boat, newly arrived, was being disgorged of partly cured
      haddock. The cargo was loaded into a wheelbarrow, transferred to the
      wharf, and there turned into a basket on a weighing scale, checked by a
      silent man in series of marks on a small book, and carried away. Beyond
      were heaped corks and spread nets and a great reel of fine cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Honora walked without an objective purpose she always came finally to
      the water. It held no surprise for her; there was practically nothing she
      was directly interested in seeing. She stood&mdash;as at present&mdash;gazing
      down into the tide clasping the piles, or away at the horizon, the Narrows
      opening upon the sea. She exchanged unremarkable sentences with familiar
      figures, watched the men swab decks or tail new cordage through blocks,
      and looked up absently at the spars of the schooners lying at anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put on a summer dress again of white India barège, a little hat
      with a lavender bow, and she stood with her silk shawl on an arm. The
      stillness of the day was broken only by the creak of the wheelbarrow. Last
      night she had been rebellious, but now a lassitude had settled over her:
      all emotion seemed blotted out by the pouring yellow light of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side of the wharf a small warehouse held several men in the office,
      the smoke of pipes lifting slowly from the open door; and, at the sound of
      footfalls, she turned and saw Jem Stanes entering the building. His
      expression was surprisingly morose. It was, she thought again as she had
      of Jason Burrage striding darkly along the street, singularly inopportune
      at the arrival of so much good fortune. A burr of voices, thickened by the
      salt spray of many sea winds, followed. She heard laughter, and then Jem's
      voice, indistinguishable but sullenly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora progressed up into the town, walked past the courthouse square, and
      met Jason at the corner of the street. &ldquo;I am glad to have a chance to
      welcome you,&rdquo; she said, extending her hand. Close to him her sense of
      familiarity faded before the set face, the tightly drawn lips and hard
      gaze. She grew a little embarrassed. He had on another, still more
      surprising waistcoat, his watch chain was ponderous with gold; but dust
      had accumulated unattended on his shoulders, and dimmed the luster of his
      boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied non-committally, giving her palm a brief pressure.
      He stood silently, without cordiality, waiting for what might follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safely back with the Golden Fleece,&rdquo; she continued more
      hurriedly, &ldquo;after yoking the fiery bulls and sailing past the islands of
      the sirens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about all that,&rdquo; he said stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason and the Argonauts,&rdquo; she insisted, conscious of her stupidity. He
      was far more compelling than she had remembered, than he appeared from a
      distance: the marked discontent of his earlier years had given place to a
      certain power, repose: the romance which she had decided was his main
      characteristic was emphasized. She was practically conversing with a
      disconcerting stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olive was, of course, delighted,&rdquo; she went resolutely on. &ldquo;You must marry
      soon, and build a mansion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not going to marry at all,&rdquo; he stated baldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; she exclaimed and then crimsoned with annoyance at the
      involuntary syllable. That idiot, Olive Stanes, she added to herself
      instantly. Honora could think of nothing appropriate to say. &ldquo;That's a
      great pity,&rdquo; she temporized. Why didn't the boor help her? Hadn't he the
      slightest conception of the obligations of polite existence? He stood
      motionless, the fingers of one hand clasping a jade charm. However, she,
      Honora Can-deray, had no intention of being affronted by Jason Burrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must find it pale here after California, if what I've heard is true,&rdquo;
       she remarked crisply, then nodded and left him. That night at supper she
      repeated the burden of what he had told her to her aunt. The latter
      answered in a measured voice without any trace of interest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought something of the kind had happened: the upstairs girl was
      saying he was drunk last night. A habit acquired West, I don't doubt. It
      is remarkable, Honora, how you remember one from another in Cottarsport.
      They all appear indifferently alike to me. And I am tremendously upset
      about Paret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not,&rdquo; Honora returned. She spoke inattentively, and she was
      surprised at the truth she had exposed. Paret Fifield had never become a
      necessary part of her existence. Except for the light he had shed upon
      herself&mdash;the sudden glimpse of multiplying years and the emptiness of
      her days&mdash;his marriage was unimportant. She would miss him exactly as
      she might a piece of furniture that had been removed after forming a
      familiar spot. She was more engrossed in what her aunt had told her about
      Jason.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been back only two or three days, and already lost his promised
      wife and got drunk. The implications of drinking were different in
      Cottars-port from what they would be in San Francisco, or even Boston; in
      such a small place as this every act offered the substance for talk,
      opinion, as long-lived as the elms on the hills. It was foolish of him not
      to go away for such excesses. Honora wanted to tell him so. She had
      inherited her father's attitude toward the town, she thought, a personal
      care of Cottarsport as a whole, necessarily expressed in an attention
      toward individual acts and people. She wished Jason wouldn't make a fool
      of himself. Then she recalled how ineffectual the same desire, actually
      voiced, had been in connection with Olive Stanes. She recalled Olive's
      horrified face as she, Honora, had said, &ldquo;Grace be damned!&rdquo; It was all
      quite hopeless. &ldquo;I think I'll move to the city,&rdquo; she informed her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter sighed, from, Honora knew, a sense of superior knowledge and
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper she deserted the more familiar drawing room for the chamber
      across the wide hall. A fire of coals was burning in an open grate, but
      there was no other light. Honora sat at a piano with a ponderous ebony
      case, and picked out Violetta's first aria from Traviata. The round sweet
      notes seemed to float away palpable and intact into the gloom. It was an
      unusual mood, and when it had gone she looked back at it in wonderment and
      distrust. Her customary inner rebellion re-established itself perhaps more
      vigorously than before: she was charged with energy, with vital
      promptings, but found no opportunity, promise, of expression or
      accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warm sun lingered for a day or so more, and then was obliterated by an
      imponderable bank of fog that rolled in through the Narrows, over Cottar's
      Neck, and changed even the small confines of the town into a vast
      labyrinth. That, in turn, was dissipated by a swinging eastern storm,
      tipped with hail, which left stripped trees on an ashen blue sky and dark,
      frigid water slapping uneasily at the harbor edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora Canderay's states of mind were as various and similar. Her outer
      aspect, however, unlike the weather, showed no evidence of change: as
      usual she drove in the carriage on afternoons when it was not too cold;
      she appeared, autocratic and lavish, in the shops of Citron Street; she
      made her usual aimless excursions to the harbor. Jem Stanes, she saw, was
      still a deck hand on the schooner <i>Gloriana</i>. Looking back to the
      morning when he had scowlingly entered the office on the wharf, she was
      able to reconstruct the cause of his ill humor&mdash;a brother-in-law to
      Jason Burrage was a person of far different employment from an ordinary
      Stanes. She passed Olive on the street, but the latter, except for a
      perfunctory greeting, hurried immediately by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stories of Jason's reckless conduct multiplied&mdash;he had consumed a
      staggering amount of Medford rum and, in the publicity of noon and
      Marlboro Street, sat upon the now notable silk hat. He had paid for some
      cheroots with a pinch of gold dust as they were said to do in the far
      West. He carried a loaded derringer, and shot &ldquo;for fun&rdquo; the jar of colored
      water in the apothecary's window, and had threatened, with a grim face, to
      do the same for whoever might interfere with his pleasures. He was, she
      learned, rapidly becoming a local scandal and menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had been any one but Jason Burrage, native born and folded in the
      glamour of his extraordinary fortune, he would have been immediately and
      roughly suppressed: Honora well knew the rugged and severe temper of the
      town. As it was he went about&mdash;attended by its least desirable
      element, a chorus to magnify his liberality and daring&mdash;in an
      atmosphere of wonderment and excited curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, she thought, was highly regrettable. Yet, in his present frame of
      mind, what else was there for him to do? He couldn't be expected to take
      seriously, be lost in, the petty affairs of Cottarsport; beyond a limited
      amount the gold for which he had endured so much&mdash;she had heard
      something of his misfortunes and struggle&mdash;was useless here; and,
      without balance, he must inevitably drift into still greater debauch in
      the large cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now a frequently recurring figure in her thought. In the correct
      presence of her aunt, Mrs. Cozzens, in delicate clothes and exact
      surroundings, the light of an astral lamp on her sharply cut, slightly
      contemptuous face, she would consider the problem of Jason Burrage. In a
      way, which she had more than once explained and justified to herself, she
      felt responsible for him. If there had been anything to suggest, she would
      have gone to him directly, but she had no intention of offering a barren
      condemnation. Her peculiar position in Cottarsport, while it indicated
      certain obligations, required the maintenance of an impersonal plane. Why,
      he might say anything to her; he was quite capable of telling her&mdash;and
      correctly&mdash;to go to the devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      A new analogy was created between Jason Bur-rage and herself: his
      advantage over her had broken down, they both appeared fast in untoward
      circumstance beyond their power to alleviate or shape. He had come back to
      Cottarsport in the precise manner in which she had returned from shorter
      but equally futile excursions. Jason had his money, which at once
      established necessities and made satisfaction impossible; and she had
      promptings, desires, that by reason of their mere being, allowed her
      contentment neither in the spheres of a social importance nor here in the
      quiet place where so much of her was rooted. As Honora Canderay gazed at
      her Aunt Herriot's hard, fine profile, the thought of her own, Honora
      Canderay's, resemblance to the returned miner carousing with the dregs of
      the town brought a shade of ironic amusement to her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora left the house, walking, in the decline of a November afternoon.
      She had been busy in a small way, supervising the filling of camphor
      chests for the winter, and, intensely disliking any of the duties of
      domesticity, she was glad to escape into the still, cold open. Dusk was
      not yet perceptible, but the narrow, erratic ways of Cottars-port were
      filling with dear grey shadow. When, inevitably, she found herself at the
      harbor's edge, she progressed over a narrow wharf to its end. It had been
      wet, and there were patches of black, icy film; the water near by was
      grey-black, but about the bare thrust of Cottar's Neck it was green; the
      warehouses behind her were blank and deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on a cloak lined with ermine, and she drew it closer about her
      throat at the frigid air lifting from the bay. Suddenly a flare of color
      filled the somber space, a coppery glow that glinted like metal shavings
      on the water and turned Cottar's Neck red. Against the sunset the town was
      formless, murky; but the sky and harbor resembled the interior of a
      burnished kettle. The effect was extraordinarily unreal, melodramtic, and
      she was watching the color fade, when a figure wavered out of the shadows
      and moved insecurely toward her. At first she thought the stumbling
      progressions were caused by the ice: then she saw that it was Jason
      Burrage, drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore the familiar suit of broadcloth, with no outer covering, and a
      rough hat pulled down upon his fixed gaze. She stood motionless while he
      approached, and then calmly met his heavy interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora,&rdquo; he articulated, &ldquo;Honora Canderay, one&mdash;one of the great
      Canderays of Cottarsport. Well, why don't you say something? Too set up
      for a civil, for a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be ridiculous, Jason,&rdquo; she replied crisply; &ldquo;and do go home&mdash;you'll
      freeze out here as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the great Canderays,&rdquo; he reiterated, contemptuously. He came very
      close to her. &ldquo;You're not much. Here they think you.... But I've been to
      California, and at the Jenny Lind... in silk like a blue bird, and sing-.
      Nobody ever heard of the Canderays in 'Frisco, but they know Jason
      Burrage, Burrage who had all the bad luck there was, and then struck it
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed perilously, and she put out a palm and steadied him. &ldquo;Go back.
      You are not fit to be around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jason struck her hand down roughly. &ldquo;I'm fitter than you. What are you,
      anyway?&rdquo; He caught her shoulder in vise-like fingers. &ldquo;Nothing but a
      woman, that's all&mdash;just a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting me,&rdquo; she said fearlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grip tightened, and he studied her, his eyes inhuman in a stony, white
      face. &ldquo;Nothing more than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very surprising,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;Do you know, I had never
      thought of it. And it's true; that is precisely what and all I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His expression became troubled; he released her, stepped back, slipped,
      and almost fell into the water. Honora caught his arm and dragged him to
      the middle of the wharf. &ldquo;A dam' Canderay,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;And I'm better,
      Jason Burrage. Ask them at the El Dorado, or Indian Bar; but that's gone&mdash;the
      early days. All scientific now. We got the dead wood on gold... cyanide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come home,&rdquo; she repeated brusquely, turning him, with a slight push,
      toward the town settled in darkness. It sent him falling forward in the
      direction she wished. Honora supported him, led him on. At intervals he
      hung back, stopped. His speech became confused; then, it appeared, his
      reason commenced slowly to return. The streets were empty; a lamp shone
      dimly on its post at a corner; she guided Jason round a sunken space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora had no sense of repulsion; she was conscious of a faint pity, but
      her energy came dimly from that feeling of obligation, inherited, she told
      herself once more, from her father&mdash;their essential attitude to
      Cottarsport. At the same time she found herself studying his face with a
      personal curiosity. She was glad that it was not weak, that rum had been
      ineffectual to loosen its hardness. He now seemed capable of walking
      alone, and she stood aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason was at a loss for words; his lips moved, but inaudibly. &ldquo;Keep away
      from the water,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;or from Medford rum. And, some evening
      soon, come to see me.&rdquo; She said this without premeditation, from an
      instinct beyond her searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do that,&rdquo; he replied in a surprisingly rational voice, &ldquo;because
      I've lost my silk hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are hundreds for sale in Boston,&rdquo; she announced impatiently; &ldquo;go
      and get another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That never came to me,&rdquo; he admitted, patently struck by this course of
      rehabilitation through a new high hat. &ldquo;There was something I had to say
      to you, but it left my mind, about a&mdash;a gold fleece; it turned into
      something else, on the wharf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you see me again.&rdquo; She moved farther from him, suddenly in a great
      necessity to be home. She left him, talking at her, and went swiftly
      through the gloom to Regent Street. Letting herself into the still hall,
      the amber serenity of lamplight in suave spaciousness, she swung shut the
      heavy door with a startling vigor. Then she stood motionless, the cape
      slipping from her shoulders in glistening and soft white folds about her
      arms, to the carpet. Honora wasn't faint, not for a moment had she been
      afraid of Jason Burrage, this was not a rebellion of over-strung nerves;
      yet a passing blindness, a spiritual shudder, possessed her. She had the
      sensation of having just passed through an overwhelming adventure: yet all
      that had happened was commonplace, even sordid. She had met a drunken man
      whom she hardly knew beyond his name and an adventitious fact, and
      insisted on his going home. Asking him to call on her had been little less
      than perfunctory&mdash;an impersonal act of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her being vibrated as if a loud and disturbing bell had been
      unexpectedly sounded at her ear; she was responding to an imperative
      summons. In her room, changing for supper, this feeling vanished, and left
      her usual introspective humor. Jason had spoken a profound truth, which
      her surprise had recognized at the time, in reminding her that she was an
      ordinary woman, like, for instance, Olive Stanes. The isolation of her
      dignity had hidden that from her for a number of years. She had come to
      think of herself exclusively as a Canderay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later her sharp enjoyment in probing into all pretensions, into herself,
      got slightly the better of her. &ldquo;I saw Jason Burrage this evening,&rdquo; she
      told Mrs. Cozzens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he was sober,&rdquo; that individual returned, &ldquo;it might be worth
      recalling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wasn't. He nearly fell into the harbor. I asked him to see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your education, Honora, there is really no excuse for confusing the
      singular and plural. I haven't any doubt you asked him here, but that has
      nothing to do with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be amused by his accounts of California. For, although you
      never complain, I can see that you think it dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an old woman,&rdquo; Herriot Cozzens stated, &ldquo;my life was quite normally
      full, and I am content here with you. Any dullness you speak of I regret
      for another reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid I'll get preserved like a salted haddock. He may not
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora was in the less formal of the drawing rooms when Jason Burrage was
      announced. He came forward almost immediately, in the most rigorous
      evening attire, a new silk hat on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no trouble getting one,&rdquo; she nodded in its direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four,&rdquo; he replied tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason took a seat facing her across an open space of darkly flowered
      carpet, and Honora studied him, directly critical. Against a vague
      background his countenance was extraordinarily pronounced, vividly pallid.
      His black hair swept in a soft wave across a brow with indented temples,
      his nose was short with wide nostrils, the lower part of his face square.
      His hands, scarred and discolored, rested each on a black-clad knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in no hurry to begin a conversation which must either be stilted,
      uncomfortable, or reach beyond known confines. For the moment her daring
      was passive. Jason Burrage stirred his feet, and she attended the movement
      with thoughtful care. He said unexpectedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I've never been in here before.&rdquo; He turned and studied his
      surroundings as if in an effort of memory. &ldquo;But I talked to your father
      once in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has been changed,&rdquo; she answered almost unintelligibly. &ldquo;Very
      little does in Cot-tarsport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;I saw it when I came back. It was just the
      same, but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped and his expression became gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean that you were different, you are wrong,&rdquo; she declared
      concisely. &ldquo;Just that has made trouble for you&mdash;you have been unable
      to be anything but yourself. I am like that, too. Every one is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been through things,&rdquo; he told her enigmatically. &ldquo;Why look&mdash;just
      the trip: to Chagres on the Isthmus, and then mules and canoes through
      that ropey woods to Panama, with thousands of prospectors waiting for the
      steamer. Then back by Mazatlan, Mexico City, and Vera Cruz. A man sees
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her inborn uneasiness at rooms, confining circumstance, her restless
      desire for unlimited horizons, for the mere fact of reaching, moving,
      stirred into being at the names he repeated. Tomorrow she would go away,
      find something new&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been horridly rough and dirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many turned back or died,&rdquo; he agreed tentatively. &ldquo;But after you
      once got there a sort of craziness came over you&mdash;you couldn't wait
      to buy a pan or shovel. The bay was full of rotting ships deserted by
      their crews, a thicket of masts with even the sails still hanging to them.
      The men jumped overboard to get ashore and pick up gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought with a pang of the idle ships with sprung rigging, sodden
      canvas lumpily left on the decks, rotting as he had said, in files. The
      image afflicted her like a physical pain, and she left it hurriedly. &ldquo;But
      San Francisco must have been full of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had to shout to be heard over the bands, and everything blazing.
      Pyramids of nuggets on the gambling tables. Gold dust and champagne and
      mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever will you find here?&rdquo; She immediately regretted her query, which
      seemed to search improperly into the failure of his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking of going back,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously Honora was sorry to hear this; unreasonably it gave to
      Cottarsport a new aspect of barrenness, the vista of her own life reached
      interminable and monotonous into the future. And she was certain that,
      without the necessity and incentive of labor, it would be destructive for
      Jason to return to San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamble,&rdquo; he replied cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable prospect,&rdquo; she said lightly. Her manner unmistakably conveyed
      the information that his call had drawn to an end. He clearly resisted
      this for a minute or two, and then stirred. &ldquo;You must come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly, grasping his hat, which had reposed on the
      carpet at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News from California, from the world outside, is rare in Cottarsport. You
      must see that you are an interesting figure to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he persisted, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, her face as hard as his own, but with a faint smile in place of
      his lowering expression. &ldquo;No, you haven't changed; not even to the extent
      of a superficial knowledge of drawing rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have seen better than come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ignorance was all my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should be enough.&rdquo; Her smile widened. Yet she was furious with herself
      for having quarreled with him; the descent from the altitude of the
      Canderays had been enormous. What extraordinary influence had colored her
      acts in the past few days?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cozzens, at breakfast, inquired placidly how the evening before had
      progressed, and Honora made a gesture expressive of its difficulties. &ldquo;You
      will create such responsibilities for yourself,&rdquo; the elder stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one, it suddenly appeared to Honora, had been thrust upon her. She
      made repeated and angry efforts to put Jason Burrage from her mind; but
      his appearance sitting before her, his words and patent discontent,
      flooded back again and again. She realized now that he was no impersonal
      problem; somehow he had got twisted into the fibres of her existence; he
      was more vividly in her thoughts than Paret Fifield had ever been. She
      attempted to ridicule him mentally, and called up pictures of his
      preposterous clothes, the ill-bred waistcoats and ponderous watch chain.
      They faded before the memory of the set jaw, his undeniable romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in fur, she elected to drive after dinner; the day was cold but
      palely clear, and she felt that her cheeks were glowing with unusual
      color. Above the town, on the hills now sere with frost and rock, the
      horses, under the aged guidance of Coggs, continually dropped from a jog
      trot to an ambling walk. Honora paid no attention to the gait, she was
      impervious to the wide, glittering reach of water; and she was startled to
      find herself abreast a man gazing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a jackass out of myself last night,&rdquo; he observed gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She automatically stopped the carriage and held back the buffalo robe.
      Jason hesitated, but was forced to take a seat at her side. Honora said
      nothing, and the horses again went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd been drinking a lot and was all on edge,&rdquo; he volunteered further. &ldquo;I
      feel different today. I can remember your mother driving like this. I was
      a boy then, and used to think she was made of ice; wondered why she didn't
      run away in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother was very kind, really,&rdquo; Honora said absently. She was relaxed
      against the cushions, the country dipped and spread before her in a
      restful brown garb; she watched Coggs' glazed hat sway against the sky.
      The old sense of familiarity with Jason Burrage came back: why not, since
      she had known him all their lives? And now, after his years away, she was
      the only one in Cottarsport who at all comprehended his difficulties. He
      was not commonplace, a strong man was never that; and, in a way, he had
      the quality which more than any other had made her father so notable. And
      he was not unpleasant so close beside her. That was of overwhelming
      importance in the formation of her intimate opinion of him. He had been
      refined by the bitterness of his early failure in California; he bore
      himself with a certain dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll I do?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the life or her she couldn't tell him. Except for platitudes she could
      offer no solution against the future. Actual living, directly viewed, was
      like that&mdash;hopeless of exterior solution. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she
      admitted, &ldquo;I wish I did; I wish I could help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This money, what's it good for? I can't get my family to burn two small
      stoves at once; they'd die in the kitchen if they had a hundred parlors;
      I've bought more clothes than I'll ever wear, four high hats and so on.
      Not going to get married; no use for a big house, for anything more than
      the room I have. I get plenty to eat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might do some good with it,&rdquo; she suggested. The base of what she was
      saying, Honora realized, was that he would be as well off with his fortune
      given away. Yet it was unjust, absurd, for him not to get some use,
      pleasure, from what he had worked so extravagantly to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow that wouldn't settle anything, for me,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coggs had turned at the usual limit of her afternoon driving, and they
      were slowly moving back to the town. Cottar's Neck was fading into the
      early gloom, and a group of men stared at Jason seated in the Canderays'
      carriage as if their eyes were being played with in the uncertain light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought any more about going West?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped for his descent at Marlboro
    </p>
    <p>
      Street, and he stood with a hand on the wheel. &ldquo;I had intended to go this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her gaze steadily, and she felt a swift coldness touch her into a
      shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo; This came in a spirit of perversity against her every other
      instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be happier in San Francisco?&rdquo; Jason Burrage made a hopeless
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... for supper,&rdquo; Honora found herself saying in a rush; &ldquo;at six o'clock.
      If you aren't bound for California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to recall afterward if she had indicated a particular evening
      for the invitation. There was a vague memory of mentioning Thursday. This
      was Tuesday... Herriot Cozzens would be in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant told her that Mr. Burrage had arrived when she was but half
      ready. She was, in reality, undecided in her choice of a dress for the
      evening; but finally she wore soft white silk, with deep, knotted fringe
      on the skirt, a low cut neck, and a narrow mantle of black velvet. Her
      hair, severely plain in its net, was drawn back from a bang cut across her
      brow. As she entered the room where he was standing a palpable admiration
      marked his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing, however, beyond a conventional phrase. Such natural
      reticence had a large part in her acceptance of him; he did nothing that
      actively disturbed her hypercritical being. He was almost distinguished in
      appearance. She had a feeling that if it had been different.... Honora
      distinctly wished for a flamboyant touch about him; it presented a symbol
      of her command of any situation between them, a reminder of her
      superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper went forward smoothly; there were the welcome inevitable
      reminiscences of the rough fare of California, laughter at the prohibitive
      cost of beans; and when, at her direction, he lighted a cheroot, and they
      lingered on at the table, Honora's aloofness was becoming a thing of the
      past. The smoke gave her an unexpected thrill, an extraordinary sense of
      masculine proximity. There had been no such blue clouds in the house since
      her father's death seven years ago. Settled back contentedly, Jason
      Burrage seemed&mdash;why, actually, he had an air of occupying a familiar
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bitterly cold without, the room into which they trailed
      insufficiently warm, and they were drawn close together at an open
      Franklin stove. The lamps on the mantel were distant, and they had not yet
      been fully turned up: his face was tinged by the glow of the fire. An
      intense face. &ldquo;What are you thinking about&mdash;me?&rdquo; she added coolly.
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I'm too comfortable to think.&rdquo; There was a note of
      surprise in his voice; he looked about as if to find reassurance of his
      present position. &ldquo;But if I did it would be this&mdash;that you are
      entirely different from any woman I've ever known before. They have always
      been one of two kinds. One or the other,&rdquo; he repeated somberly. &ldquo;Now you
      are both together. I don't know as I ought to say that, if it's nice. I
      wouldn't like to try and explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's your clothes and your manner put against what you are. Oh hell, what
      I mean is you're elegant to look at and good, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of the deepest concern followed his exclamation. He
      commenced an apology. Hardly launched, it died on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora was at once conscious of the need for his contrition and of the
      fact that she had never heard a more entertaining statement. It was
      evident that he viewed her as a desirable compound of the women of the El
      Dorado and Olive Stanes: an adroit and sincere compliment. She wanted to
      follow it on and on, unfold its every exposition; but, of course, that was
      impossible. All this she concealed behind an indifferent countenance, her
      slim white fingers half embedded in the black mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason Burrage lighted another cheroot and put his feet up on the polished
      brass railing of the iron hearth. This amused her beyond words. She
      couldn't remember when she had had another such vitalized evening. She
      realized that, through the last years, she had been appallingly lonely;
      but with Jason smoking beside her in a tilted chair the solitude was
      banished. She got a coal for him in the small burnished tongs, and he
      responded with a prodigious puff that set her to coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone the house was hatefully vacant; as she went up to her
      chamber the empty spaciousness, the semi-dark well of the stair, the high
      hall with its low-turned lamp, the blackness of the third story pouring
      down over her, oppressed her almost beyond endurance. Her Aunt Herriot,
      already old, must be dead before very long, there was none other of her
      connections who could live with her, and she would have to depend on
      perfunctory, hired companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora saw that she should never escape from the influence which held her
      in Cottarsport.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her room, the door bolted, it was no better. The interior was large,
      uncompromisingly square; and, though every possible light was burning,
      still it seemed somber, menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day was a lowering void with gusts of rain driving against
      the windows. Mrs. Cozzens would be away until tomorrow, and Honora met the
      afternoon alone. At times she embroidered, short-lived efforts broken by
      despondent and aimless excursions through the echoing halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She attempted to read, to compose herself with an elaborate gilt and
      embellished volume called &ldquo;The Garland.&rdquo; But, at a Lamentation on the
      Death of Her Canary, by a Person of Quality, she deliberately dropped the
      book into the burning coals of the Franklin stove. The satisfaction of
      seeing the pages crisp and burst into flame soon evaporated. The day was a
      calamity, the approaching murky evening a horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper she wondered what Jason Burrage was doing. A trace of the odor
      of his cheroot lingered in the dining room. He was an astonishingly solid,
      the only, actuality in a nebulous world of lofty, flickering ceilings and
      the lash of rain. He might as well smoke in her drawing room as in the
      Burrage kitchen. Paret Fifield would have drifted naturally to the
      Canderay house, but not Jason, not a native of Cottarsport.... With an air
      of determination she sharply pulled the plush, tasseled bell rope in the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the servant open the front door; there was a pause&mdash;Jason
      was taking off his greatcoat&mdash;after which he entered, calm and
      without query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was tired of sitting by myself,&rdquo; she said with an air of entire
      frankness. In a minute or so more it was all as it had been the evening
      before&mdash;she held a coal for his cheroot as he tilted back beside her
      with his feet on the rail. &ldquo;You are a very comfortable man, Jason,&rdquo; she
      told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, although a quiver crossed his lips. Then, after a
      little, &ldquo;It's astonishing how soon you get used to things. Seems as if I
      had been here for years, and this is only the third time.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought any more of California?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faced her with an expression of surprise. &ldquo;It had gone clean out of my
      mind. I suppose I will shift back, though&mdash;nothing here for me. I
      can't come to see you every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She preserved a silence in which they both fell to staring into a dancing,
      bluish flame. The gusts of rain were audible like the tearing of heavy
      linen. An extraordinary idea had taken possession of Honora&mdash;if the
      day had been fine, if she had been out in a sparkling air and sun, a very
      great deal would have happened differently. But just what she couldn't
      then say: the fact alone was all that she curiously apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; she answered, so long after his last statement that he
      gazed questioningly at her. &ldquo;I wonder if it has occurred to you,&rdquo; she
      continued, &ldquo;how much alike we are? I often think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it hasn't. Jason Bur-rage and Honora Canderay! I
      wouldn't have guessed it, and I don't believe any one else ever has. I'd
      have a hard time thinking about two more different. It's&mdash;it's
      ridiculous.&rdquo; He became seriously animated. &ldquo;Here I am&mdash;well, you know
      all about me&mdash;with some money, perhaps, and a little of the world in
      my head; but you're Honora Canderay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said once that I was nothing but a woman,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that,&rdquo; he admitted with evident chagrin. &ldquo;I was drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's when the truth is often hit on; I am quite an ordinary sort of
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said last evening I had some of a very common quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you mustn't take that serious,&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;it was just in a way
      of speech. I told you I couldn't rightly explain myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; she asserted bluntly, &ldquo;I am lonely. What will you do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His amazement turned into a consternation which even now she found almost
      laughable. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;There's no way I can help you. You are
      having a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She realized, with a feeling that her knowledge came too late, that she
      was entirely serious. Jason Burrage was the only being alive who could
      give her any assistance, yes, save her from the future. Her hands were
      cold, she felt absolutely still, as if she had suddenly turned into
      marble, a statue with a heart slightly fluttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could be here a lot,&rdquo; she told him, and then paused, glancing at him
      swiftly with hard, bright eyes. He had removed his feet from the stove,
      and sat with his cheroot in a poised, awkward hand. She was certain that
      he would never speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honora was startled at the ease with which the words were pronounced, and
      conscious of an absurdly trivial curiosity&mdash;she wondered just how
      much he had been shocked by her proposal? She saw that he was stupefied.
      Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we might,&rdquo; he pronounced idiotically. &ldquo;There isn't any real reason why
      we shouldn't. That is&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;Where does the laugh
      start?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Honora was overwhelmed, not by what she had said, but by the
      whole difficulty and inner confusion of her existence. She turned away her
      head with an unintelligible period. A silence followed, intensified by the
      rain flinging against the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bad night,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banality saved her. Again practically at her ease, she regarded him
      with slightly smiling lips. &ldquo;I believe I've asked you to marry me,&rdquo; she
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jason Burrage. He stood up. &ldquo;If you mean it, I'd like to
      very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better sit down,&rdquo; she went on in an impersonal voice; &ldquo;there ought
      to be a lot of things to arrange. For instance, hadn't we better live on
      here, for a while anyhow? It's a big house to waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honora, you'll just have to stop a little,&rdquo; he asserted; &ldquo;I'm kind of
      lost. It was quick in California, but that was a funeral procession
      compared with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that it was done, she was frightened. But there was time to escape
      even yet. She determined to leave the room quickly, get away to the safety
      of her bolted door, her inviolable privacy. She didn't stir. An immediate
      explanation that she hadn't been serious&mdash;how could he have thought
      it for a moment!&mdash;would save her. But she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden enthusiasm lighted up his immobile face. &ldquo;I'll get the prettiest
      diamond in Boston,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she commenced, struggling still to retreat. He
      misunderstood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best,&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone she remained seated in the formal chamber. At any rate
      she had conquered the emptiness of her life, of the great square house
      above her. It was definitely arranged, they were to marry. How amazed
      Herriot Cozzens would be! It was probable that she would leave
      Cot-tarsport, and her, Honora, immediately. Jason hadn't kissed her, he
      had not even touched her hand, in going. He had been extremely subdued,
      except at the thought of the ring he would buy for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were phases of the future which she resolutely ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cozzens came back as had been planned, and Honora told her at once.
      The older woman expressed her feeling in contained, acid speech. &ldquo;I am
      surprised he had the assurance to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason didn't,&rdquo; Honora calmly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's your father,&rdquo; the elder stated; &ldquo;he had some very vulgar blood. I
      felt that it was a calamity when my sister accepted him. A Cot-tarsport
      person at heart, just as you are, always down about the water and those
      low docks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you're right, and so it's much better for me to find where I
      belong. I have tried to get away from Cottarsport, and from the sea and
      the schooners sailing in and out of the Narrows, a thousand times. But I
      always come back, just as father did, back to this little place from the
      entire world&mdash;China and Africa and New York. The other influences
      weren't strong enough, Aunt Herriot; they only made me miserable; and now
      I've killed them. I'll say good-bye to you and Paret and the cotillions.&rdquo;
       She kissed her hand, but not gaily, to a whole existence irrevocably lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Jason's ring blazing on her slim finger she drove, the day before the
      wedding, for the last time as Honora Canderay. The leaves had been
      stripped from the elms on the hills, brown and barren against the
      flashing, steely water. She saw that Coggs was so impotent with age that
      if the horses had been more vigorous he would be helpless. Coggs had
      driven for her father, then her, for thirty years. It was too cold for the
      old man to be out today. His cheeks were dark crimson, and continually wet
      from his failing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herriot Cozzens had left her; Coggs... all the intimate figures of so many
      years were vanishing. Jason remained. He had almost entirely escaped
      annoying her, and she was conscious of his overwhelming admiration, the
      ineradicable esteem of Cottarsport for the Canderays; but a question, a
      doubt more obscure than fear, was taking possession of her. After all she
      was supremely ignorant of life; she had been screened from it by pride and
      luxurious circumstance; but now she had surrendered all her advantage. She
      had given herself to Jason; and he was life, mysterious and rude. The
      thunder of large, threatening seas, reaching everywhere beyond the placid
      gulf below, beat faintly on her perception.

    <h2>
      JASON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N an unfamiliar
      upper room of the Canderays' house Jason stood prepared for the signal to
      descend to his wedding. The ceremony was to occur at six o'clock; it was
      now only five minutes before&mdash;he had absently looked at his watch a
      great many times in a short space&mdash;and he was striving to think
      seriously of what was to follow. But in place of this he was passing again
      through a state of silent, incoherent surprise. This was the sort of thing
      for which a man might pinch himself to discover if he were awake or
      dreaming. In five, no, four, minutes now Honora Canderay was to become
      his, Jason Burrage's, wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain complacency had settled over him in the past few days, something
      of his inborn feeling of the Canderays as a house apart seemed to have
      evaporated; and, in addition, he had risen&mdash;Honora wouldn't take any
      just happen so. Jason was never notable for humility. Yet who, even after
      he had returned from California with his riches, could have predicted this
      evening? His astonishment was as much at himself, illuminated by
      extraordinary events, as at any exterior circumstance. At times he had the
      ability to see himself, as if from the outside; and that view, here, was
      amazing. Why, only a short while ago he had been drinking rum in the shed
      in back of &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; Clower's house, perhaps the least desirable shed in
      Cottarsport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one fact, however, he was certain&mdash;no more promiscuous draughts of
      Medford. He recognized that he had taken so much not from the presence of
      desire, but from a total absence of it as well as of any other mental
      state. &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; and his associates, too, were now a thing of the past, a
      bitterly rough and vacant element. The glass lamp on a bureau was smoking:
      he stepped forward to lower the wick, when a knock fell on the door. A
      young Boston relative of Honora's&mdash;a supercilious individual in
      checked trousers and lemon-colored gloves&mdash;announced that they were
      waiting for Jason below. With a determined settling of his shoulders and
      tightly drawn lips, he marched resolutely forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was to be in the chamber across from the one in which he had
      generally sat. Smilax and white Killamey roses had been bowed over the
      mantel at the farthest end, and there Jason found the clergyman waiting.
      The room was half full of people occupying chairs brought from other parts
      of the house; and he was conscious of a sudden silence, an intent, curious
      scrutiny, as he entered. An instinctive antagonism to this deepened in
      him: he felt that, with the exception of his father and mother, he hadn't
      a friend in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such other local figures as were there were facilely imitating the cold
      stare of Honora's connections. He stood belligerently facing Mrs. Cozzens'
      glacial calm, the inspection of a man he had seen driving with Honora in
      Cottarsport, now accompanied by a pettish, handsome girl, evidently his
      wife. His father's weathered countenance, sunken and dry on its bones, was
      blank, except for a faint doubt, as if some mistake had been made which
      would presently be exposed, sending them about face. His mother, however,
      was triumphant pride and justification personified. Then the music
      commenced&mdash;a harp, violin, and double bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding ring firmly secured, Jason stirred with a feeling of
      increasing awkwardness. He glared back, with a protruding lip, at the
      fellow with the young wife, at the small, aggressive group from Boston;
      and then he saw that Honora was in the room. She was coming slowly toward
      him. Her expression of absolute unconcern released him from all petty
      annoyance, any thought of the malicious onlookers. As she stopped at his
      side she gave him a slight nod and smile; and at that moment a tremendous,
      sheer admiration for her was born in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora had chosen to be unattended&mdash;she had coolly observed that she
      was well beyond the age for such sentimentality&mdash;and he realized that
      though the present would have been a racking occasion for most women, it
      was evident that she was not disturbed in the least. He had a general
      impression of sugary white satin, of her composed, almost disdainful face
      in a cloud of veil with little waxen orange flowers, of slender still
      hands, when they turned from the room to the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone over the marriage service together, he had read it again in
      the kitchen at home; he was fairly familiar with its periods and
      responses, and got through with only a slight hesitation and half
      prompting. But the thickness of his voice, in comparison with Honora's
      open, decisive utterance, vainly annoyed him. He wanted desperately to
      clear his throat. Suddenly it was over, and Honora, in a swirl of satin,
      was sinking to her knees. Beside her he listened with a feeling of
      comfortable lull to a lengthy prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, he perfunctorily clasped a number of indifferent palms, replied
      inanely to gabbled expressions of good will and hopes for the future
      unmistakably pessimistic in tone. Honora told him in a rapid aside the
      names of those approaching. She smiled radiantly at his father and mother,
      leaned forward and whispered in the latter's ear; and they followed the
      guests streaming into the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There champagne was being opened by the caterer's assistants from Boston.
      There were steaming platters of terrapin and oysters and fowl. The table
      bore pyramids of nuts and preserved fruit, hot Cinderellas in cups with
      sugar and wine, black case cake, Savoy biscuits, pumpkin paste, and
      frothed creams with preserved peach leaves. A laden plate was thrust into
      Jason's hand, and he sat with it in a clatter of voices and topics that
      completely ignored him. He was isolated in the absorption of food and
      wine, in a conversational exchange as strange to him as if had been spoken
      in a foreign language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora was busily talking to young Mrs. Fifield&mdash;he remembered the
      name now. Apparently she had forgotten his existence. At first this
      annoyed him; he determined to force his way into their attention, but a
      wiser realization held him where he was. Honora was exactly right: he had
      nothing in common with these people, probably not one of them would come
      into his life or house again. And his wife, in the fact of her marriage,
      had clearly signified how little important they were to her. His father
      joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made certain when the New York packet leaves?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything's fixed,&rdquo; Jason reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother wanted to see you. But she got set and is kind of timid about
      moving.&rdquo; Jason rose promptly, and, with the elder, found Mrs. Hazzard
      Burrage. &ldquo;I'd like to have Honora, too,&rdquo; the latter told them, and Jason
      turned sharply to find her. When they stood facing the old couple his
      mother hesitated doubtfully; then she put out her hand to the woman in
      wedding array. But Honora ignored it; leaning forward she kissed the
      round, bright cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to be patient with them at times,&rdquo; the mother said, looking up
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid Jason will need that warning,&rdquo; Honora replied; &ldquo;he is a very
      imprudent man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason's mind returned to this later, sitting in the house that had been
      the Canderays', but which now was his too. Honora's remark to his mother
      had been clear in itself, but it suggested wide speculations beyond his
      grasp. For instance&mdash;why, after all, had Honora married him? He was
      forced to acknowledge that it was not the result of any overwhelming
      feeling for him. The manner of their wedding, the complete absence of the
      emotion supposed to be the incentive of such consummations, Honora
      herself, all, denied any effort to fix such a personally satisfactory
      cause. That she might have had no other opportunity&mdash;Honora was not
      so young as she had been&mdash;he dismissed as obviously absurd. Why&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze was fastened upon the carpet, and he saw that time and the
      passage of feet had worn away the design. He looked about the room, and
      was surprised to discover a general dinginess which he had never noticed
      before. He said nothing, but, in his movements about the house, examined
      the furnishings and walls, and an astonishing fact was thrust upon him&mdash;the
      celebrated dwelling was grievously run down. It was plain that no money
      had been spent on it for years. The carriage, too, and the astrakhan
      collar on Coggs' coat, were worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered this at breakfast&mdash;his wife behind a tall Sheffield
      coffee urn&mdash;and he was aware of the cold edge of a distasteful
      possibility. The thought enveloped him insidiously, like the fog which
      often rolled through the Narrows and over the town, that the Canderays
      were secretly impoverished, and Honora had married him only for his money.
      Jason was not resentful of this in itself, since he had been searching for
      a motive he could accept, but it struck him in a peculiarly vulnerable
      spot&mdash;his admiration for his wife, for Honora. The idea, although he
      assured himself that the thing was readily comprehensible, somehow managed
      to diminish her, to tarnish the luster she held for him. It was far
      beneath the elevation on which Cottarsport had placed the Canderays; and
      he suffered a distinct sense of loss, a feeling of the staleness and
      disappointment of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he considered this explanation the more he was convinced of its
      probability. A great deal of his genuine warmth in his marriage
      evaporated. Still&mdash;Honora had married him, she had given herself in
      return for what material advantage he might bring; and he would have to
      perform his part thoroughly. He ought to have known that&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What he must do now was to save them both from any painful revelation by
      keeping for ever hid that he was aware of her purpose, he must never
      expose himself by a word or act; and he must make her understand that
      whatever he had was absolutely hers. It would be necessary for her to go
      to the money with entire freedom and without any accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, he found, was not so easy to establish as he thought. Honora was his
      wife, but nevertheless there was a well marked reticence between them, a
      formal nicety with which he was heartily in accord. He couldn't just
      thrust his fortune before her on the table. He hesitated through the day,
      on the verge of various blunders; and then, in the evening, said in a
      studied causality of manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about fixing some of the rooms over new? You might get
      tired of seeing the same things for so long. I saw real elegant furniture
      in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked about indifferently. &ldquo;I think I wouldn't like it changed,&rdquo; she
      remarked, almost in the manner of a defense. &ldquo;I suppose it does seem worn
      to you; but I'm used to it; there are so many associations. I am certain
      I'd be lost in new hangings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jason was so completely silenced by her reply that he felt he must have
      shown some confusion, for her gaze deliberately turned to him. &ldquo;Is there
      any particular thing you would like repaired?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;I think it's all splendid. I
      wouldn't change a curtain, only&mdash;but....&rdquo; He cursed himself for a
      clumsy fool while Honora continued to study him. He endeavored to shield
      himself behind the trivial business of lighting a cheroot; but he felt
      Honora's query searching him out. Finally, to his extreme dismay, he heard
      her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jason, I believe you think I married you for money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pretense, he realized, would be no good now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that did occur to me,&rdquo; he acknowledged desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she told him sharply. &ldquo;I could be cross very easily. You are too
      stupid. Father did wonderfully well on his voyages, and his profit was
      invested by Frederic Cozzens, one of the shrewdest financiers of his day.
      I have twice, probably three times, as much as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She confronted him with a faintly sparkling resentment. However, the
      pleasure, the reassurance, in what he had just heard made him indifferent
      to the rest. It was impossible now to comprehend how he had been such a
      block! He even smiled at her, which, he was delighted to observe,
      obviously puzzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to tell you, Jason, and perhaps it is too late already,
      that I thought I married you because I was lonely, because I feared the
      future. Anyhow, that's what I told myself the night I sent for you. You
      might have a right to complain very bitterly about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have, I won't,&rdquo; he assured her cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that then; but now I am not at all sure. It no longer seems so
      simple, so easily explained. I used to feel that I understood myself very
      thoroughly, I could look inside and see what was there; but in the last
      month I haven't been able to; and it is very disturbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow we're married,&rdquo; he announced comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a beautiful way to feel,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I appear to get less sure
      of things as I grow older, which is pathetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wondered what, exactly, she meant by this. Honora said a great many
      little things which, their meaning escaping him, gave him momentary
      doubts. He discovered that she had a habit of saying things indirectly,
      and that, as the seriousness of the occasion increased, her manner became
      lighter and he could depend less on the mere order of her words. This
      continually disconcerted him, put him on the defensive and at small
      disadvantages: he was never quite at ease with Honora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obversely&mdash;the ugly shade of mercenary purpose dispelled&mdash;close
      at hand his admiration for her grew. Every detail of her living was as
      fine as that publicly exposed in the drawing room. She was not rigidly and
      impossibly perfect, in, for instance, the inflexible attitude of Olive
      Stanes; Honora had a very human impatience, she could be disagreeable, he
      found, in the morning, and she undoubtedly felt herself superior to the
      commonalty of life. But in the ordering of her person there was a
      wonderfully exact delicacy and fragrant charm. Just as she had no formal
      manner, so, he discovered, she possessed no &ldquo;good&rdquo; clothes; she dressed
      evidently from some inner necessity, and not merely for the sake of
      impression. She had, too, a remarkable vigor of expression; Honora was not
      above swearing at contradictory circumstance; and she was so free of small
      pruderies that often she became a cause of embarrassment to him. At times
      he would tell himself uneasily that her conduct was not quite ladylike;
      but at the same instant his amusement in her would mount until it
      threatened him with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal to be learned from Honora, he told himself; and
      then he would speculate whether he were progressing in that acquisition;
      and whether she were happy; no, not happy, but contented. Ignorant of her
      reason for marrying, he vaguely dreaded the possibility of its departure,
      mysterious as it had come, leaving her regarding him with surprise and
      disdain. He tried desperately, consciously, to hold her interest and
      esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the base of his conception of their married existence, which,
      then, he was entirely willing to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as the weeks multiplied without bringing him any corresponding
      increase in the knowledge of either Honora or their true situation, he was
      aware of a disturbance born of his very pleasure in her; an uncomfortable
      feeling of insecurity fastened upon him. But all this he was careful to
      keep hidden. There was evidently no doubt in the minds of Cottarsport of
      the enviableness of his position&mdash;with all that gold, wedded to
      Honora Canderay, living in the Canderay mansion. The more solid portion of
      the town gave him a studied consideration denied to the mere acquisition
      of wealth; and the rough element, once his companion but now relentlessly
      held at a distance, regarded him with a loud disdain fully as humanly
      flattering. Sometimes with Honora he passed the latter, and they grumbled
      an obscure acknowledgment of his curt greeting; when he was alone, they
      openly disparaged his attainments and qualified pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; Clower, an able seaman whose indolent character had
      dissipated his opportunities of employment without harming his slow,
      powerful body; Emery Radlaw, the brother of the apothecary and a graduate
      of Williams College, a man of vanished refinements and taker of strange
      drugs, as thin and erratically rapid in movements as Clower was slow;
      Steven, an incredibly soiled Swede; John Vleet, the master and part owner
      of a fishing schooner, a capable individual on the sea, but an insanely
      violent drunkard on land. There were others, all widely different, but
      alike in the bitterness of a common failure and the habit of assuaging
      doubtful self-esteem, of ministering to crawling nerves, with highly
      potential stimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason passed &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; and Emery Radlaw on a day of late March, and a mocking
      and purposely audible aside almost brought him to an adequate reply. He
      had disposed of worse men than these in California and the Isthmus. His
      arrogant temper rose and threatened to master him; but something more
      powerful held him steadily and silently on his way. This was his
      measureless admiration for Honora, his determination to involve her in
      nothing that would detract from her fineness and erect pride. Brawling on
      the street would not do for her husband. He must give her no cause to
      lessen what incomprehensible feeling, liking, she might have for him, give
      life to no regrets for a hasty and perhaps only half considered act. After
      this, in passing any of his late temporary associates, he failed to
      express even the perfunctory consciousness of their being.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In April he was obliged to admit to himself that he knew no more of
      Honora's attitude toward him than on the day of their wedding. He
      recognized that she made no show of emotion; it was an essential part of
      her to seem at all times unmoved. That was well enough for the face she
      turned toward the world; but directed at him, her husband, its enigmatic
      quality began to obsess his mind. What Honora thought of him, why she had
      married him, became an almost continuous question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It bred an increasing sense of instability that became loud, defiant. More
      than once he was at the point of self-betrayal: query, demand, objection,
      would rise on a temporary angry flood to his lips. But, struggling, behind
      a face as unmoved as Honora's own, he would suppress his resentment, the
      sense of injury, and smoke with the appearance of the greatest placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His regard for his wife placed an extraordinary check on his impulses and
      utterance. He deliberated carefully over his speech, watched her with an
      attention not far from a concealed anxiety, and was quick to absorb any
      small conventions unconsciously indicated by her remarks. She never
      instructed or held anything over him; he would have been acutely sensitive
      to any air of superiority, and immediately antagonized. But Honora was
      entirely free from pretensions of that variety; she was as clear and
      honest as a goblet of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason's regard for her grew pace by pace with the feeling of baffling
      doubt. He was passing through the public square, and his thoughts were
      interrupted by a faint drifting sweetness. &ldquo;I believe the lilacs are out,&rdquo;
       he said unconsciously aloud and stopping. His surrounding was remarkably
      serene, withdrawn&mdash;the courthouse, a small block of brick with white
      corniced windows, flat Ionic portico, and slatted wood lantern with a
      bell, stood in the middle of the grassy common shut in by an irregular
      rectangle of dwellings with low eaves and gardens. The sun shone with a
      beginning warmth in a vague sky that intensified the early green. It
      seemed that he could see, against a house, the lavender blur of the lilac
      blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his attention was attracted by the figure of a man, at once strange
      and familiar, coming toward him with a dragging gait. Jason studied the
      other until a sudden recognition clouded his countenance, filled him with
      a swift, unpleasant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Whenever did you get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; said Thomas Gast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, here was Thomas returned from California like himself. Yet the most
      negligent view of the latter revealed that there was a vast difference
      between Jason and this last Argonaut&mdash;Thomas Gast's loosely hung jaw,
      which gave to his countenance an air of irresolution, was now exaggerated
      by an aspect of utter defeat. His ill conditioned clothes, sodden brogans,
      and stringy handkerchief still knotted miner-fashion about his throat, all
      multiplied the fact of failure proclaimed by his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you strike it?&rdquo; Jason uselessly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What chance has the prospector today?&rdquo; the other heatedly and indirectly
      demanded. &ldquo;At first a man could pan out something for himself; but now
      it's all companies, all capital. The state's interfered too, claims are
      being held up in court while their owners might starve; there are new laws
      and trimmings every week. I struck it rich on the Reys, but I was drove
      out before I could get my stakes in. They tell me you did good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; Jason replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And married Honora Canderay, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other assented shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some are shot with luck,&rdquo; Thomas Gast proclaimed; &ldquo;they'd fall and skin
      their face on a nugget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worked my passage in a crazy clipper with moon-sails and the halliards
      padlocked to the rail. Carried away the foretopmast and yard off the Horn
      and ran from port to port in a hundred and four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation dwindled and expired. Thomas Gast gazed about moodily,
      and Jason, with a tight mouth, nodded and moved on. His mind turned back
      abruptly to Eddie Lukens, the man who had robbed him of his find in the
      early days of cradle mining, the man he had killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said nothing of this to Honora; the experience with Olive Stanes
      had convinced him of the advisability of keeping past accident where, he
      now repeated, it belonged. He despaired of ever being able, in
      Cottarsport, to explain the place and times that had made his act
      comprehensible. How could he picture, here, the narrow ravines cut by
      swift rivers from the stupendous slopes and forests of the Sierra Nevada,
      the isolation of a handful of men with their tents by a plunging stream
      in' a rift so deep that there would be only a brief glimmer of sunlight at
      noon? And, failing that, the ignorant could never grasp the significance
      of the stillness, the timeless shadows, which the miners penetrated in
      their madness for gold. They'd never realize the strangling passion of
      this search in a wilderness without habitation or law or safety. They
      could not understand the primary justice of such rude courts as the miners
      were able to maintain on the more populous outskirts of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, Jason Burrage, had been tried by a jury for killing Eddie Lukens, and
      had been exonerated. It had been months since he had reiterated this
      dreary and only half satisfying formula. The inner necessity filled him
      with a shapeless concern such as might have been caused by a constant,
      unnatural shadow flickering out at his back. He almost wished that he had
      told Honora at the beginning; and then he fretfully cursed the incertitude
      of life&mdash;whatever he did appeared, shortly after, wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was obvious that he couldn't go to her with the story today; the
      only time for that had been before his marriage; now it would have the
      look of a confession of weakness, opportunely timed; and he could think of
      nothing more calculated to antagonize Honora than such a crumbling
      admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had been re-animated by the mere presence of Thomas Gast in
      Cottarsport; certainly, he concluded, an insufficient reason for his
      troubling. Gast had been a miner, too, he was familiar with the conditions
      in the West.... There was a great probability that he hadn't even heard of
      the unfortunate affair; while Olive Stanes would be dragged to death
      rather than garble a word of what he had told her: Jason willingly
      acknowledged this of Olive. He resolutely banished the whole complication
      from his mind; and, walking with Honora after supper over the garden in
      back of their house, he was again absorbed by her vivid delicate charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden was deep and narrow, a flight of terraces connected by a
      flagged path and steps. At the bottom were the bergamot pear trees that
      had been Ithiel Canderay's especial charge in his last, retired years.
      Their limbs, faintly blurred with new foliage, rose above the wall,
      against a tranquil evening sky with a white slip of May moon. The peace
      momentarily disturbed in Jason Burrage's heart flooded back, a sense of
      great well-being settled over him. Honora rested her hand within his arm
      at an inequality of the stone walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really a very bad wife, Jason,&rdquo; she said suddenly; &ldquo;self-absorbed
      and inattentive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suit me,&rdquo; he replied inadequately. He was extraordinarily moved by
      her remark: she had never before even suggested that she was conscious of
      obligation. He wanted to put into words some of the warmth of feeling
      which filled his heart, but suitable speech evaded him. He could not shake
      off the fear that such protestations might be displeasing to her
      restrained being. Moving slightly away from him she seemed, in the soft
      gloom, more wonderful than ever. Set in white against the depths of the
      garden, her face, dimly visible, appeared to be without its customary
      faintly mocking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Jason,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how I once said I thought I was
      marrying you because I was lonely, and that I found out it wasn't so? I
      didn't know why.&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was enveloped by an intense eagerness to hear her to the end: it might
      be that something beyond his greatest hopes was to follow. But
      disappointment overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was certain I'd see more clearly into myself soon, but I haven't; it's
      been useless trying. And I've decided to do this&mdash;to give up thinking
      about things for myself, and to wait for you to show me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't do that,&rdquo; he protested, facing her; &ldquo;more-than half the time
      I wonder over almost that same question&mdash;why you ever married me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a frightful situation,&rdquo; she observed with a return of her
      familiar manner; &ldquo;two mature people joined for life, and neither with the
      slightest idea of the reason. Anyhow I have given it up.... I suppose I'll
      die in ignorance. Perhaps I was too old&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her with an uncustomary incivility, a heated denunciation
      of what she had been about to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are not sorry,&rdquo; he remarked after a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;and I'm certain I shan't be. I'm not that sort
      of person. I would go down to ruin sooner than regret.&rdquo; She said no more,
      but went into the house, leaving Jason in the potent spring night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer any doubt about the lilacs: the air was laden with
      their scent. An entire hedge of them must have blossomed as he was
      standing there. He moved to the terrace below: there might be buds on the
      pear trees. But it was impossible to see the limbs. How could Honora
      expect him to make their marriage clear? He had never before seen her face
      so serene. He thought that he heard a vague stir outside the wall, and he
      remembered the presence of a semi-public path. Now there was a cautious
      mutter of voices. He advanced a step, then stopped at a scrambling of
      shoes against the wall. A vague form shouldered into view, momentarily
      clinging above him, and a harsh voice cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murderer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even above the discordant dash of his startled sensibilities rose the
      fear, instantaneously born, that Honora had heard. All the vague
      uneasiness which had possessed him at Thomas Gust's return solidified into
      a recognizable, leaden dread&mdash;the conviction that his wife must learn
      the story of his misadventure, told with animus and lies. Then a more
      immediate dread held him rigidly attentive: there might be a second cry, a
      succession of them shouted discordantly to the sky. Honora would come out,
      the servants gather, while that accusing voice, indistinguishable and
      disembodied by the night, proclaimed his error. This was not the shooting
      of Eddie Lukens, but the neglect to comprehend Honora Canderay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute silence followed. He made a motion toward the wall, but,
      oppressed by the futility of such an act, arrested himself in the midst of
      a step and stood with a foot extended. The stillness seemed to thicken the
      air until he could hardly breathe; he was seized by a sullen anger at the
      events which had gathered to betray him. The crying tones had been like a
      chemical acting on his complexity, changing him to an entirely different
      entity, darkening his being; the peace and fragrance of the night were
      destroyed by the anxiety that now sat upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced that nothing more was to follow here, he was both impelled into
      the house, to Honora, and held motionless by the fear of seeing her turn
      toward him with her familiar light surprise and a question. However, he
      slowly retraced his way over the terraces, through a trellis hung with
      grape vines, and into the hall. As he hoped, Honora was on the opposite
      side of the dwelling. She had heard nothing. Jason sat down heavily, his
      gaze lowered and somber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling smote him that he should tell Honora of the whole miserable
      business at once, make what excuse for himself was possible, and prepare
      her for the inevitable public revelation. He pronounced her name, with the
      intention of doing this; but she showed him such a tranquil, superfine
      face that he was unable to proceed. Her interrogation held for a moment
      and then left him, redirected to a minute, colorful square of glass beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      A multiplication of motives kept him silent, but principal among them was
      the familiar shrinking from appearing to his wife in any little or mean
      guise. It was precisely into such a peril that he had been forced. He
      felt, now, that she would overlook a murder such as the one he had
      committed far more easily than an intangible error of spirit. He could
      actually picture Honora, in his place, shooting Eddie Lukens; but he
      couldn't imagine her in his humiliating situation of a few minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the consideration of who it might be that had called over the
      wall, and immediately recognized that it was one of a small number, one of
      &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; Clower's gang: Thomas Gast would have gravitated quickly to their
      company, and their resentment of his, Jason Burrage's, place in life must
      have been nicely increased by Gast's jealousy. The latter, Jason knew, had
      not washed an honest pan of gravel in his journey and search for a
      mythical easy wealth; he had hardly left the littered fringe of San
      Francisco, but had filled progressively menial places in the less
      admirable resorts and activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      With so much established beyond doubt he was confronted by the necessity
      for immediate action, the possibility of yet averting all that threatened
      him, of preserving his good opinion in Honora's eyes. Clower and Emery
      Radlaw and the rest, with the balance of neither property nor position,
      lawless and inflamed with drink, were a difficult opposition. He repeated
      that he had mastered worse, but out in California, where a man had been
      nakedly a man; and then he hadn't been married. There he would have found
      them at once, and an explosion of will, perhaps of powder, would soon have
      cleared the atmosphere. But in Cottarsport, with so much to keep intact,
      he was all but powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, the following day, when he saw the apothecary's brother enter the
      combined drug and liquor store, he followed; and, to his grim
      satisfaction, found Thomas Gast already inside. The apothecary gave Jason
      an inhospitable stare, but the latter ignored him, striding toward Gast.
      &ldquo;Just what is it you've brought East about me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other avoided the query, his gaze shifting over the floor. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
       Jason insisted, after a pause. Thomas Gast was leaning against a high
      counter at one side, behind which shelves held various bottles and paper
      boxes and tins. The counter itself was laden with scales and a mortar,
      powders and vividly striped candy in tall glass jars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well as I do,&rdquo; Gast finally admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we're both certain there's no reason for name-calling over my back
      wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shot him, didn't you?&rdquo; the other asked thinly. &ldquo;You can't get away
      from the fact that you killed a pardner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Jason Burrage harshly. &ldquo;He robbed me. But I didn't shout
      thief at him from the safety of the dark; it was right after dinner, the
      middle of the day. He was ready first, too; but I shot him. Can you get
      anything from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to realize this isn't San Francisco,&rdquo; Radlaw, the drug taker,
      put in. &ldquo;A man couldn't be coolly derringered in Cottarsport. There's law
      here, there's order.&rdquo; He had a harried face, dulled eyes under a fine
      brow, a tremulous flabby mouth, with white crystals of powder adhering to
      its corners, and a countenance like the yellow oilskins of the fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason turned darkly in his direction. &ldquo;What have you or Clower got to do
      with law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only them,&rdquo; the apothecary interposed, &ldquo;but all the other men of the
      town are interested in keeping it orderly. We'll have no western rowdyism
      in Cottarsport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hear this,&rdquo; Jason again addressed Thomas Gast; &ldquo;see that you tell
      the truth and all the truth. My past belongs to me, and I don't aim to
      have it maligned by any empty liar back from the Coast. And either of you
      Radlaws&mdash;I'm not going to be blanketed by the town drunkards or old
      women, either. If I have shot one man I can shoot another, and I care this
      much for your talk&mdash;if any of this muck is allowed to annoy Mrs.
      Burrage I'll kill whoever starts it, spang in the middle of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where it gets him,&rdquo; the ex-scholar stated. &ldquo;Just there,&rdquo; Jason
      agreed; &ldquo;and this Gast, who has brought so much back from California, can
      tell you this, too&mdash;that I had the name of finishing what I began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, once more outside, alone, his appearance of resolution vanished: the
      merest untraceable rumor would be sufficient to accomplish all that he
      feared, damage him irreparably with Honora. He was far older in spirit and
      body than he had been back on Indian Bar; he had passed the tumultuous
      years of living. The labor and privation, the continuous immersion in
      frigid streams, had lessened his vitality, sapped his ability for
      conflict. All that he now wished was the happiness of his wife, Honora,
      and the quietude of their big, peaceful house; the winter evenings by the
      Franklin stove and the spring evenings with the windows open and the
      candles guttering in the mild, lilac-hung air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Together with his uncertainty the pleasure in the sheer fact of his wife
      increased; and with it the old wonderment at their situation returned.
      What, for instance, did she mean by saying that he must explain her to
      herself? He tried again all the conventional reasons for marriage without
      satisfaction: the sentimental and material equally failed. Jason felt that
      if he could penetrate this mystery his grasp on actuality would be
      enormously improved; he might, with such knowledge, successfully defy
      Thomas Gast and all that past which equally threatened to reach out
      destructively into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      His happiness, in its new state of fragility, became infinitely precious;
      a thing to dwell on at nights, to ponder over walking through the town.
      Then, disagreeably aware of what overshadowed him, he would watch such
      passersby as spoke, searching for some sign of the spreading of his old
      fault. Often he imagined that he saw such an indication, and he would
      hurry home, in a panic of haste&mdash;which was, too, intense reluctance&mdash;to
      discover if Honora yet knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her a hundred times determined to end his misery of
      suspense, and face the incalculable weight of her disdain; but on each
      occasion he failed as he had at the first. Now his admission seemed too
      damned roundabout; in an unflattering way forced upon him. His position
      was too insecure, he told himself.... Perhaps the threat in the
      apothecary's shop would be sufficient to shut the mouth of rumor. It had
      not been empty; he was still capable of uncalculating rage. How closely
      was Honora bound to him? What did she think of him at heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't bear to remember how he had laid open her dignity, the dignity
      and position of the Canderays in Cottarsport, to whispered vilification.
      Connected with him she was being discussed in &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; Clower's shanty. His
      mind revolved endlessly about the same few topics, he elaborated and
      discarded countless schemes to secure Honora. He even considered giving
      Thomas Gast a sum of money to repair what harm the latter had wrought.
      Useless&mdash;his danger flourished on hatred and envy and malice. However
      exculpable the killing of Eddie Lukens had been, the results were
      immeasurably unfortunate, for a simple act of violent local justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the carriage above Cottarsport; Coggs had died through the
      winter, and his place been taken by a young coachman from the city. The
      horses rested somnolently in their harness, the bright bits of rubbed
      silver plate shining. Honora was looking out over the harbor, a gentian
      blue expanse. &ldquo;Good Heavens,&rdquo; she cried with sudden energy, &ldquo;I am getting
      old at a sickening rate. Only last year the schooners and sea made me as
      restless as a gull. I wanted to sail to the farthest places; but now the
      boats are&mdash;are no more than boats. It fatigues me to think of their
      jumping about; and I haven't walked down to the wharves for six weeks. Do
      I look a haggard fright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem as young as before I went to California,&rdquo; he replied simply. She
      did. A strand of hair had slipped from its net, and wavered across her
      flawless cheek, her lips were bright and smooth, her shoulders slimly
      square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a marvelous woman, Honora,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, smiling. &ldquo;I wonder if you realize that that is your
      first compliment of our entire wedded life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous,&rdquo; he declared incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I'm complimenting you all the time. I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly expect me to hear thoughts,&rdquo; she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He silently debated another&mdash;it was to be about the ribbon on her
      throat&mdash;but decided against giving it voice. Why, like the reasons
      for so much else, he was unable to say; they all had their root in the
      blind sense of the uncertainty of his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the evening his thoughts shifted ceaselessly from one position
      to another. This, he realized, could not continue indefinitely; soon, from
      within or out, Honora and himself must be revealed to each other. He was
      permeated by the weariness of constant strain; the peace of the past
      months had been destroyed; it seemed to him that he had become an alien to
      the serenity of the high, tranquil rooms and of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose early the following morning, and descended into a rapt purity of
      sunlight and the ecstatic whistling of robins. The front door had not been
      opened; and, as he turned its shining brass knob, his gaze fell upon a
      sheet of paper projecting below. Jason bent, securing it, and, with a
      premonition of evil, thrust the folded scrap into his pocket. He turned
      through the house into the garden; and there privately scrutinized a half
      sheet with a clumsily formed, disguised writing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he read, &ldquo;will serve you notice to move on. Dangerous customers
      are not desired here. Take a suggestion in time and skip bad consequences.
      You can't hide back of your wife's hoops.&rdquo; It was signed &ldquo;Committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A robin was thrilling the air with melody above his head. Jason listened
      mechanically as the bird ended his song and flew away. Then the
      realization of what he had found overwhelmed him with a strangling
      bitterness: he, Jason Burrage, had been ordered from his birthplace, he
      had been threatened and accused of hiding behind a woman, by the
      off-scouring of the alleys and rum holes. A feeling of impotence thrust
      its chilling edge into the swelling heat of his resentment. He would have
      to stand like a condemned animal before the impending fatal blow; he was
      held motionless, helpless, by every circumstance of his life and hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crumpled the warning in a clenched hand. How Cottarsport would point
      and jeer at him, at Jason Burrage who was Honora Canderay's husband, a
      murderer; Jason, who had returned from California with the gold fleece! It
      wasn't golden, he told himself, but stained&mdash;a fleece dark with
      blood, tarnished from hellish unhappiness, a thing infected with
      immeasurable miseries. Its edge had fallen on Olive Stanes and left her&mdash;he
      had passed her only yesterday&mdash;dry-lipped and shrunken into sterile
      middle age. It promised him only sorrow, and now its influence was
      reaching up toward Honora, in herself serenely apart from the muck and
      defilement out of which he thought he had struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun, rising over the bright spring foliage, filled the garden with
      sparkling color. His wife, in a filmy white dress, called him to
      breakfast. She waited for him with her faint smile, against the cool
      interior. He went forward isolated, lonely, in his secret distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      This communication, like the spoken accusation of a previous evening, was,
      apparently, bare of other consequences. Jason's exterior life progressed
      without a deviation from its usual smooth course. It was clear to him that
      no version of the facts about the killing of Eddie Lukens had yet spread
      in Cottarsport. This, he decided, considering the character of Thomas
      Gast, the oblique quality of his statements, was natural. He could not
      doubt that such public revelation, if threat and intimidation failed, must
      come. Meanwhile he was victimized by a growing uncertainty&mdash;from what
      direction would the next attack thrust?
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled grimly to himself at the memory of the withdrawn and secure
      aspect of the town when he had first returned from the West. To him,
      striding across the hills from the Dumner stage, it had resembled an
      ultimate haven. The seeming harmony and peace of the grey fold of houses
      about their placid harbor had concealed possibilities of debasement as low
      as California's worst camps. Now, successful, when he had looked for the
      reward of his long years of brutal toil, the end of struggle, he was
      confronted by the ugliest situation of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad that he had always been a silent man, or Honora would have
      noticed and demanded the cause of the moroseness which must have settled
      over him. They sat no longer before the stove in the drawing room, but on
      a side porch that commanded an expanse of lawn and a high privet hedge,
      while he smoked morosely at the inevitable cheroots, gloomily searching
      for a way from the difficulty closing in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora had been to Boston, and she was describing lightly an encounter
      with her aunt, Herriot Cozzens. He was only half conscious of her amused
      voice. Clouds had obscured the evening sky, and there was an air of
      suspense, like that preceding a thunder storm, in the thickening dark. A
      restlessness filled Jason which he was unable to resist; and, with a
      short, vague explanation, he rose and proceeded out upon the street.
      There, his hands clasped behind his back and head lowered, he wandered on,
      lost in inner despondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned into the courthouse square, dimly lighted by gas lamps at its
      outer confines, and paced across the grass, stirring a few wan fireflies.
      It was blacker still beyond the courthouse. He stumbled slightly,
      recovered himself, and wearily commenced a return home. But he had
      scarcely taken a step when a figure closed in upon him, materializing
      suddenly out of the darkness. He stopped and was about to speak when a
      violent blow from behind grazed his head and fell with a splintering
      impact on his shoulder. He stood for a moment bewildered by the unexpected
      pain; then, as he saw another shape, and another, gather around him, he
      came sharply to his senses. His hand thrust into a pocket, but it was
      empty&mdash;he had laid aside the derringer in Cottarsport.
    </p>
    <p>
      His assailants grappled with him swiftly, and he swayed struggling and
      hitting out with short blows in the center of a silent, vicious conflict.
      A rough hard palm was crushed against his mouth, a head ground into his
      throat, and a heavy, mucous breath of rum smote him. There was muttered
      cursing, and low, disregarded commands. A cotton handkerchief, evidently
      used as a mask, tore off in Jason's hand; strained voices, their caution
      lost in passion, took unmistakably the accents of &ldquo;Pack&rdquo; Clower and the
      Swede, Steven. A thinner tone outside the swirling bodies cried low and
      urgent, &ldquo;Get it done with.&rdquo; A fist was driven again Jason's side, leaving
      a sharp, stabbing hurt, a heavy kick tore his thigh. Then he got his
      fingers into a neck and put into the grip all the sinewy strength got by
      long years with a miner's pan and shovel. A choked sob responded, and
      blood spread stickily over his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Jason Burrage that he was shaking himself free, that he was
      victorious; with a final supreme wrench he stood alone, breathing in
      gusts. There was a second's imponderable stillness, and then the entire
      night appeared to crash down upon his head...
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it was the flumed river, all their summer's labor, bursting
      over him. He was whirled downward through a swift course of jagged pains,
      held under the hurtling water and planks and stones. He fought, blind and
      strangled, but he was soon crushed into a supine nothingness. Far below,
      the river discharged him: he was lying beside a slaty bank in which the
      gold glittered like fine and countless fish scales. But he couldn't move,
      and the bank flattened into a plain under a gloomy ridge, with a camp of
      miners. He saw that it was Sunday, for the men were all grouped before the
      tents singing. There was Eddie Lukens gravely waving a hand to the beat of
      the melody:=
    </p>
    <p>
                "'Don't you cry for me.
    </p>
    <p>
                I'm going to Calaveras
    </p>
    <p>
                With my wash bowl on my knee.'&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      It was undoubtedly Eddie, his partner, but he had never seen him so white
      and&mdash;why, he had a hole over his eye! Eddie Lukens was dead; it
      wasn't decent for him to be standing up, flapping his hands and singing.
      Jason bent forward to remonstrate, to persuade him to go back&mdash;back
      to where the dead belonged. Then he remembered, but it was too late: Eddie
      had him in an iron clutch, he was dragging him, too, down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jason made a convulsive effort to escape, he threw back his head, gasping;
      and saw Honora, his wife, bending over him. The tormenting illusion slowly
      perished&mdash;this was Cottarsport and not California, he was back again
      in the East, the present, married to Honora Canderay. An astounding fact,
      but so. Through the window of his room he could see the foliage of a great
      horse-chestnut tree that stood by the side walk; it was swelling into
      flower. Full memory now flooded back upon him, and with it the realization
      that probably his happiness was destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to tell how much Honora knew of the cause of the assault
      upon him. She was always like that&mdash;enigmatic. But, whatever she knew
      now, soon she would have to hear all. Even if he wished to lie, it would
      be impossible to fabricate, maintain, a convincing cover for what had
      happened. The most superficial, necessary investigation would expose the
      story brought home by Thomas Gast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had come when he must confide everything to Honora; perhaps she
      would overlook his cowardice. About to address her, he fell into a
      bottomless coma, and a day passed before he had gathered himself
      sufficiently to undertake his task. She was sitting facing him, her chair
      by a window, where her fingers were swiftly and smoothly occupied. Her
      features were a little blurred against the light, and&mdash;her
      disconcerting scrutiny veiled&mdash;he felt this to be an assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those men who broke me up,&rdquo; he began dis-jointedly, surprised at the thin
      uncertainty of his voice, &ldquo;I know pretty well who they are. Ought to get
      most of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought you could say,&rdquo; she rejoined in an even tone. &ldquo;Some guesses
      were made, but it was better to wait till you could give a statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I badly hurt, Honora?&rdquo; he asked suddenly. &ldquo;Not dangerously,&rdquo; she
      assured him. &ldquo;You have splendid powers of recuperation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to go on,&rdquo; he added hurriedly, &ldquo;and tell you the rest&mdash;why
      I was beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better not,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;You ought to be as calm as
      possible. It may quiet you, Jason, to hear that I know now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what the town has been saying,&rdquo; he cried in bitter revolt, &ldquo;what
      lies Thomas Gast spread. You've heard all the envy and malice and drunken
      vileness of sots. It isn't right for you to think you know before I could
      speak a word of defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only what the town says, Jason,&rdquo; she replied simply, &ldquo;but the truth.
      Olive Stanes told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; An excited weakness broke his voice in a sob, and
      Honora rose, crossing the room to his bed. &ldquo;You must positively stop
      talking of this now,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;If you attempt it I shall go away and
      send a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was helpless against her will, and sank into semi-slumberous wonder.
      Honora knew all: Olive Stanes had told her. She was as noncommittal, he
      complained to himself, as a wooden Indian. She might have excused him
      without a second thought, and it might be that she had finished with him
      entirely, that she was merely dispensing a charity and duty; and, moving
      uneasily, or lying propped up in a temporary release from suffering, he
      would study her every movement in an endeavor to gain her all-important
      opinion of him as he had been lately revealed. It was useless; he was
      always, Jason felt, in a state of disturbing suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to end it, however, in spite of what Honora had said, on an
      afternoon when he was supported down to the street and the carriage. His
      wife took her place at his side, and they rolled forward into the
      expansive warmth of summer. Jason was impressed by the sheer repetition of
      life; and it seemed to him that this was the greatest happiness possible&mdash;such
      a procession of days and drives, with Honora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her throat rose delicately from ruffled lace, circled by a narrow black
      velvet band with a clasp of remarkable diamonds; and he smiled at the
      memory of how he had once thought she was marrying him for money. That
      seemed years ago, but he was no nearer the solution of her motive now than
      then. Her slim hands were folded in her lap&mdash;how beautifully they
      were joined at the wrists; her tapering fingers were like ivory. As he
      studied them he was startled at their suddenly meeting in a rigid clasp,
      the knuckles white and sharp. He looked up and saw that they were drawing
      near a small group of men outside the apothecary's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious silence fell upon these as the carriage approached: there were
      the two Radlaws, one saturnine and bleak, the other greenish, shattered by
      drugs; Thomas Gast; Vleet, the fishing schooner's master, and a casual,
      familiar passerby. Jason Burrage stared at them with a stony ominous
      countenance, at which Gast made a gesture of combined insolence and
      uncertainty. Jason had sunk back on the cushions when he was astonished by
      Honora's commanding the coachman to stop. It was evident that she was
      about to descend; he put out a hand to restrain her, but she disregarded
      him. His astonishment increased to incredulity and then fear; he rose
      hurriedly, but relaxed with a mutter of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora, a Canderay, had taken the carriage whip from its holder, and was
      walking, direct and composed, toward Thomas Gast. She stopped a short
      distance away: before an exclamation, a movement, was possible she had
      swept the thong of the whip across Gast's face. The blow was swung with
      force, and the man faltered, a burning welt on the pallor of his
      countenance. The coachman and Jason Burrage in the carriage, the men
      together on the sidewalk, seemed part of an inanimate group of which the
      only thing endowed with life was the whip flickering again, cutting and
      wrapping, about a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curiously ruthless impersonality about Honora's erect
      presence, her icy cold profile. Memories of old stories of Ithiel
      Canderay, the necessary salt cruelness of punishment in ships, flashed
      through Jason's mind. An intolerable weight of time seemed to drag upon
      him. Thomas Gast gave a hoarse gurgle and lurched forward, but the
      relentless lash drove him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You whisperer!&rdquo; Honora said in her ringing voice, &ldquo;you liar and
      slabbering coward! It's necessary to cut the truth out of you. When you
      talk again about Mr. Burrage and the man he shot in California don't leave
      out the smallest detail of his exoneration. Say that he had been robbed,
      the other broke one of the first laws of miners and should have been
      killed. You'd not have done it&mdash;a knife in the back would be your
      thought&mdash;but a man would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung the whip down on the bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Gast pressed his hands to his face, and slow red stains widened
      through his fingers. The apothecary stood transfixed; his brother was
      shaking in a febrile and congested horror. The woman turned disdainfully,
      moving to the carriage; the coachman descended and offered his arm as she
      mounted to the seat. The reins were drawn and the horses started forward
      in a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honora's gaze was set, looking directly ahead; her hands, in her lap of
      flowered muslin, were now relaxed; they gave an impression of crushing
      weariness. Jason's heart pounded like a forge hammer; a tremendous
      realization was forced into his brain&mdash;he need never again question
      why Honora had married him; his doubts were answered, stopped, for ever.
      He turned to her to speak an insignificant part of his measureless
      gratitude, but he was choked, blinded, by a passion of honor and homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze sought him, and there was a faint tremor of her lips; it grew
      into the shadow of an ironic smile. Suddenly it was borne upon his new,
      acquiescent serenity that Honora would always be a Canderay for him, he
      must perpetually think of her in the terms of his early habit; she would
      eternally be a little beyond him, a being to approach, to attend, with
      ceremony. The memory and sweep of all California, the pageant of life he
      had seen on the way, his own boasted success and importance, faded before
      the solid fact of Honora's commanding heritage in life, in Cottarsport.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
